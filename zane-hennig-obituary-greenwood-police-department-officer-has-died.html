He was a loyal and kind member of the force, and his loss will be deeply felt. Officer Hennig, who was born and passed away was remembered for his selflessness, generosity, and dedication to his job.</p><p>Officer Hennig may not have been a Cubs fan, but he understood and valued Wrigley Field as a once-in-a-lifetime experience for any sports fan. His enthusiasm for life went well beyond baseball, and he valued the time spent with loved ones beyond everything else.</p><p>The weekend he and his family spent with his best friend was one such treasured recollection. They celebrated life’s wonders and the perks of friendship together. Immediately following his time and their loved ones, Officer Hennig expressed his appreciation to them for the kind invitation and the memorable experiences they provided.</p><p>Officer Hennig’s service to the community didn’t stop when he took off his uniform. He personified selflessness at a time when such traits were increasingly rare in public servants. Officer Hennig went to the house after a devastating storm, saw the magnitude of the devastation, and immediately gave up his day off to help clear fallen trees and aid others in need. His character and the principles he upheld are reflected in such gestures of generosity and communal spirit.</p><p>At a time when police are under intense scrutiny, Officer Hennig exemplified the highest standards of public service and protection. Not only did he fulfill the duties of his position, but he also showed how much he cared about his fellow residents.</p><p>In honour of Officer Zane Hennig’s service and commitment to the neighborhood, we ask that you please consider making a donation to our police force. The efforts of law enforcement personnel like Officer Hennig deserve our undying gratitude and support. Officer Zane Hennig leaves behind his close family, Those he helped and protected, as well as his friends and family, will always cherish his legacy in their minds and hearts.</p><p>There will be a memorial service honoring Officer Hennig’s life and service. Everyone is welcome to pay their respects to this extraordinary officer who touched so many people’s lives. As we remember and celebrate the life of Officer Zane Hennig, may he rest in peace and may his legacy of selflessness, compassion, and dedication serve as an inspiration to us all.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiglZbDprrLsmSmnZ2kv6qty6xlnKedZMeiusRmn56mnp60brvBoquumaKueqi%2BxJ6lsKefmXqxu8uimp5llJq9or7TppynrF2ks6e1wp6pZqCRqHqltcSdZg%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fzane-hennig-obituary-greenwood-police-department-officer-has-died.html&text=Zane%20Hennig%20Obituary%2c%20Greenwood%20Police%20Department%20Officer%20Has%20Died&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fzane-hennig-obituary-greenwood-police-department-officer-has-died.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fzane-hennig-obituary-greenwood-police-department-officer-has-died.html&title=Zane%20Hennig%20Obituary%2c%20Greenwood%20Police%20Department%20Officer%20Has%20Died" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fzane-hennig-obituary-greenwood-police-department-officer-has-died.html&title=Zane%20Hennig%20Obituary%2c%20Greenwood%20Police%20Department%20Officer%20Has%20Died" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fzane-hennig-obituary-greenwood-police-department-officer-has-died.html&title=Zane%20Hennig%20Obituary%2c%20Greenwood%20Police%20Department%20Officer%20Has%20Died" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fzane-hennig-obituary-greenwood-police-department-officer-has-died.html&description=Zane%20Hennig%20Obituary%2c%20Greenwood%20Police%20Department%20Officer%20Has%20Died" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./20-photos-of-the-girls-from-below-deck.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="20 Photos Of The Girls From Below Deck">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./tim-marshall-has-passed-away.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Tim Marshall Has Passed Away, Obituary News, Louisville KY Mourns Beloved Proprietary Clients Los">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
