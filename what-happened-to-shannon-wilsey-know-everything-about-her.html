After a brief stay with her father in Oxnard, Shannon went on to live with her grandparents in Mission Viejo, where she attended high school.</p><p>Shannon Wilsey typically went by her stage name, Savannah.</p><p>Wilsey was credited with her real name in a number of B movies.

It was Pera who later discovered Wilsey in the garage of Wilsey’s home.</p><p>Wilsey did not die immediately; she died hours later in the hospital, after her father decided to shut down her life support systems once it became obvious that she would not survive her injury.</p><p>Wilsey’s ex-boyfriend, comedian Pauly Shore, stated that he was with her when she died in St. Joseph’s Hospital in Burbank.</p><p>Wilsey’s funeral, two days later, was attended by friends, family, and limited numbers of adult industry associates. Shore was the only one of her ex-boyfriends to attend the service.</p><p>Of Wilsey, Shore said, “She was the nicest, most beautiful girl I ever met … [her death] was a very dramatic thing for me.” When asked why she killed herself, he said, “She became Savannah. She became her character, who was into drugs, and needed reassurance all the time. She forgot who Shannon was … I knew she wanted out.”</p><p>Wilsey’s death was the third high-profile suicide in the adult industry.</p><p>After her death, Bill Margold founded Protecting Adult Welfare (P.A.W.), a non-profit organization that provides counseling for adult performers in need.</p><p>Her body was cremated and the ashes given to family & friends.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=shannon-wilsey-height-weight></span>Shannon Wilsey Height & Weight<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><strong>How tall was Shannon Wilsey?</strong> She stands at a height of 5 ft 10 in tall or else 1.78 m or 178 cm.
