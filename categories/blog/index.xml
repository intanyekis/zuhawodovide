バンド解散後もソロで活動したり、ZONEの再結成時も活躍していました。
2013年に所属してる事務所から突如契約解除が通告され、現在は芸能界自体を引退されています。
今日は長瀬実夕さんが事務所をクビになった理由と、現在の既婚などの情報について整理してみたいと思います。
ZONEのボーカル・MIYU（長瀬実夕）の現在。ソロでの歌手活動や結婚の噂 ZONEのギターボーカル・MIYUさんの本名は長瀬実夕です。
MAIKOさんを除くメンバーと同様に北海道札幌市出身です。
北国出身らしい白い肌と、クリッとした愛らしい目元が人気でした。
芸名 MIYU 本名 長瀬実夕 出身地 北海道札幌市 生年月日 1988年5月20日 血液型 Ｂ型 職業 歌手 MIYUさんは10歳だった1998年に入所していた芸能養成スクールのスタジオ・ランタイムで、当時がダンス&amp;amp;ーカルグループであったZONEにMIYU名義で加入しました。
突然、バンド形式のユニットに切り替わった為、MIYUさんはギター技術が追いつかず、出だしの時期はずっと当て振りだったようです。
ZONEのボーカルとしては、生意気なキャラが受けてバラエディでも活躍されました。
MIYUの現在。直近までにネットで”劣化した”したと話題。結婚が噂される ”歌がうまくて面白い子”として順調にZONEのメンバーとして活動していましたが、ZONE自体は2005年を最後に解散。
その後は数年間はソロ活動、別ユニットでの活動を続けました。
ソロでは”Miyu”の名義で5枚のシングルと1枚のアルバムをリリース。
解散直後の大人になったMIYUさんに対しては「かっこいい」「色気がある」として好評でした。
2枚目シングルと、３枚目シングルが連続でオリコン１０位を記録しましたが、ヒット作に恵まれることはありませんでした。
ZONEが復活し数年だけ元メンバーと共に活動しましたが、その後に契約解除となり芸能界を引退しています。
引退する直前までに、「化粧が濃くなった」「劣化した」とネガティブなことが言われていましたが、基本的にネットで流出してる写真は2011年前後のコンディションの悪かった時期のモノです。
引退前の2012年の彼女は普通に美人であり、契約解除された2013年以降の姿はネットにはありませんので、酷く劣化としてる証拠はありません。
2020年頃に元メンバーのMAIKOさんが結婚して子供を産んでいたことが話題となっていましたが、その際にはMIYUさんの近況も噂になりました。
MAIKOさんが結婚して子供を産んだことを公にしていなかったことで、「もしかしてMIYUさんも？」との声も出たのです。
現在までにMIYUさんの結婚や相手のことについては報道されていませんが、MAIKOさんのようにセカンドステージで再注目される時期が来れば、近況も明かされることでしょう。
MIYUの解雇理由の不良行動。ZONE時代からわがままな性格？山下智久との熱愛や薬物疑惑 2005年に解散してしまったZONEですが、2011年に東日本大震災復興支援の目的で再結成。
その際にボーカルだったMIYUさんも招集されました。
しかし、同年にTOMOKAが脱退すると、翌年2012年にはMAIKOとの2人体制となりました。
さらに、1年後には所属事務所から契約解除が発表されました。
MIYUさんが首になった理由は、”著しい不品行及び度々の業務不履行”とされています。
↓株式会社ランタイムミュージックエンタテインメントが平成25年に公式HPで発表した契約会解除の挨拶が以下です↓
皆さま方におかれましては，ZONEを応援して頂き誠にありがとうございます。
デビュー以来ZONEを応援して頂いたファンの皆様、そして関係各位の皆様には大変残念なお知らせになります。
ZONEのメンバーMIYUこと長瀬実夕には，著しい不品行及び度々の業務不履行などの行為があり、これによりファンの皆様，関係各位に大変なご迷惑をお掛けし，弊社にも多大な損害を生じさせました。弊社は，長瀬実夕に対し，指導・説得を繰り返して参りましたが，残念ながら改善は見られませんでした。
そのため、弊社は，長瀬実夕との専属契約を続けていくことが困難であると判断し，長瀬実夕との専属契約を本日付けにて解除することとなりました。
今後、長瀬実夕個人の言動行動に関しては一切弊社には関わり合いございませんので、ご理解を頂きますようお願い申し上げます。
当時はMIYUさんがどのような素行をしたのか、疑問の声が多くありました
長瀬実夕は素行が悪くワガママ放題だった？ MIYUさんの契約解除が報道された前後に、東スポから彼女の超わがままぶりが報道されていました。</description></item><item><title>Britney Spears Net Worth | TheRichest</title><link>/britney-spears-net-worth.html</link><pubDate>Sun, 07 Jul 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>youremail@domain.com (Some Person)</author><guid>/britney-spears-net-worth.html</guid><description>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BvsdOwpqusmGSwprjEm2asoZ6csrN7waugraaVrnq0vMSaqaxlnprBbsPOq6uhZw%3D%3D</description></item><item><title>Hope Solo Net Worth | TheRichest</title><link>/richest-soccer-player-athletes.html</link><pubDate>Sun, 07 Jul 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>youremail@domain.com (Some Person)</author><guid>/richest-soccer-player-athletes.html</guid><description>Hope Solo Birthname Hope Amelia Solo Birthdate July 30, 1981 Birthplace Richland, Washington, USA Height 5′ 9″ (1.75 m) Weight 140 lbs (63.5 kg) Education University of Washington Profession Soccer Player Net worth $3,000,000 Source of Wealth Football Nationality American Country United States Marital Status Married (Jerramy Stevens) Quick LinksEarnings &amp;amp; Financial Data American professional soccer player Hope Amelia Solo has an estimated net worth of $3 million.</description></item><item><title>Patricia Derges | TG Time</title><link>/patricia-derges-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-instagram-biography-60191-html.html</link><pubDate>Sun, 07 Jul 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>youremail@domain.com (Some Person)</author><guid>/patricia-derges-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-instagram-biography-60191-html.html</guid><description>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tcLGrqCdnaSeuqZ6wqikaKiVpL2tsY6pmK2qmZi2onnDnqmgnaNitaa1xqGrZq%2BVnrSpwIynnK1lp6S%2FtbSMmp6eZZKev7W0w5qwZq%2BZoLaxscOimGavmKR6qrrSrZigqpGieqO1zqCpmqiYrnp3fJByaGegpKK5cK3TrZicoJ2au7V7z5qrq6GTnq5usMSrnp6r</description></item><item><title>Ruby Maguire Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</title><link>/ruby-maguire-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography-195958-html.html</link><pubDate>Sun, 07 Jul 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>youremail@domain.com (Some Person)</author><guid>/ruby-maguire-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography-195958-html.html</guid><description>Ruby Maguire is the oldest girl of Spiderman entertainer Tobey Maguire.
