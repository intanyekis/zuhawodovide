JR’s full name is Robert Lamar Stafford Jr., and he often goes by Robert Sleepy. He is the older brother of Lil Nas X, whose real name is Montero Lamar Hill.

JR and Lil Nas X thought it would be a fun and exciting experience, as well as a way to promote their music and brand</p><p>However, JR and Lil Nas X’s secret did not last long, as they were exposed by clues and hints that revealed their connection. JR’s clue in the trivia challenge was “Nicki Minaj had a fan page called ‘nasamaraj’ which was run by JR’s relative”, which referred to Lil Nas X’s former Twitter account, where he was a fan of Nicki Minaj. JR also told a story about his relative stopping a concert to use the bathroom, which happened to Lil Nas X. JR was eventually eliminated in the eighth episode, after he failed to guess Chris’ identity correctly. He then revealed that he was Lil Nas X’s brother, and received a video message from him, expressing his love and support</p><p>JR and Lil Nas X are two talented and ambitious rappers, who have proven their skills and creativity in the rap game. They are also good friends and brothers, who have supported and inspired each other. They are related by blood and family, and they are proud of it.
