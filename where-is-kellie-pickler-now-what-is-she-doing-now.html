It’s unclear what she’s doing right now, but fans can stay up to date via her official website and social media pages. She received three upvotes from the judges and left her job at Sonic to pursue a career in music. More than 15 years later, Kellie, now 35, lives the blessed life in Nashville and hosts SiriusXM’s show The Highway.</p><p>She remains a simple and authentic person, enjoying activities such as gardening, puzzles and good conversation. Despite her success as an actress, talk show host and singer, she considers it only a small part of her life. Kellie has been happily married to Kyle Jacobs since 2011 and is excited to give new artists a chance to be discovered through her new hosting gig.</p><h2><span id=Who_is_Kellie_Pickler>Who is Kellie Pickler?</span></h2><p>Kellie Dawn Pickler is a multi-talented American artist born on June 28, 1986, known for her country music singing, songwriting, acting and television presenting skills. She became popular as a contestant on the fifth season of American Idol, where she finished in sixth place. In 2006, Kellie signed to 19 Recordings and BNA Records, and later that year released her debut album, Small Town Girl.</p><p><span class=ctaText>See also</span>&nbsp; <span class=postTitle>Ryan Mallett Wikipedia, Wiki, Cause of Death, Wife, Florida, Drowing, Destin, News, Beach, Net Worth, High School, Twitter, Family, Dead, Reddit, Kids, Instagram, Destin fl</span></p><p>This album was certified gold by the RIAA and spawned three hit singles on Billboard’s Hot Country Songs chart. Her self-titled second album, released in 2008, had four singles that achieved moderate success. In 2012, Kellie was ranked as the 14th best former student on American Idol, and later that year she signed a contract with Black River Entertainment.</p><p>She won the sixteenth season of Dancing with the Stars in 2013 with her partner Derek Hough and was inducted into the North Carolina Music Hall of Fame in 2016. Kellie hosted the national daytime TV talk show Pickler & Ben with comedian Ben Aaron from 2017 to 2019 .</p><h2><span id=How_is_Kellie_Pickler_doing_now>How is Kellie Pickler doing now?</span></h2><p>Kellie Pickler began hosting The Highway midday show on SiriusXM in February 2022 via satellite and the SXM app. In a statement, she expressed her excitement to connect with country music fans across North America and share her favorite songs and artists while interviewing special guests. However, the news came just weeks after her husband, Kyle Jacobs, was found dead in their Nashville home on February 17th.</p><p>Jacobs was a well-known songwriter and producer who worked with various country music artists, including Pickler. Despite the tragic loss, Pickler did not make any public statements regarding her husband’s death.</p><h2><span id=Husband_of_Kellie_Pickler>Husband of Kellie Pickler</span></h2><p>Kyle Christopher Jacobs was a talented American country musician who worked as a writer for Curb Music from 2003 until his untimely death in February 2023. He was a multi-talented individual who played piano, guitar and sang. He is originally from Bloomington, Minnesota. Jacobs was known for co-writing Garth Brooks’ hit single “More Than a Memory,” which made history by debuting at No. 1 on the Billboard country singles chart.</p><p>He is also credited with co-writing Kimberley Locke’s top 10 hit, “8th World Wonder,” and his songs have been recorded by many other notable artists such as Kellie Pickler (his wife), Trace Adkins, Jo Dee Messina, Craig Morgan, Tim McGraw, Clay Walker, Kelly Clarkson, Scotty McCreery, among many others.</p><p>Jacobs has worked with several famous artists and writers such as Darius Rucker, Rachel Thibodeau and Wynonna. Additionally, he starred alongside his wife Kellie Pickler in the CMT reality series I Love Kellie Pickler.</p><h2><span id=Update_by_Kellie_Pickler>Update by Kellie Pickler</span></h2><p>Kellie Pickler and her husband Kyle Jacobs shared a loving and musical relationship that spanned more than a decade before his untimely death. While Pickler was a well-known country music artist, Jacobs was an award-winning songwriter who often worked with his wife to bring her songs to life.</p><p>The pair met in the early 2000s through a mutual friend, and Jacobs impressed Pickler with his musical talent when they first met. After getting engaged in 2010, they decided to hold a low-key ceremony in Antigua on New Year’s Day 2011. They later starred in the CMT reality series I Love Kellie Pickler, which chronicled their happy relationship.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>WOW! 11yrs ago…time sure does fly!

Although Pickler did not make a public statement after her husband’s death, the couple openly expressed their love and shared a personal and professional relationship.</p><p>They collaborated on songwriting and USO tours, and even starred in a reality show together for three seasons. However, their marriage was their priority, and Jacobs stated in 2015 that their relationship will always come first, above their careers or other occupations.</p><p>“Whatever the job is, if it ever gets in the way of our marriage, then it gets in the way,” Jacobs said back in 2015. “Our marriage comes first.” “We love that our marriage is number one, it will always be number one. But one of our favorite things to do is laugh. And we want to show that to people,” he said.</p><p>Disclaimer: The above information is for general information purposes only.
