In the 1990s he played the role again in an animated series for the UPN network, <a href=#>The Incredible Hulk</a> (1996) -- this time providing the creature's voice. In <a href=#>Ang Lee</a>'s 2003 film <a href=#>Hulk</a> (2003) the Hulk is computer-generated, so Lou plays a completely different part - that of a security guard (along with <a href=#>Stan Lee</a>) at the lab where Bruce Banner works. In the 2008 film <a href=#>The Incredible Hulk</a> (2008), he plays a security guard again, this time one who allows Bruce Banner to enter with a pizza -- and also, once again, voices the Hulk.</td></tr><tr readability=4.8059701492537><td>15</td><td>Beat out <a href=#>Arnold Schwarzenegger</a> for the role of the Hulk on the TV series <a href=#>The Incredible Hulk</a> (1978).
