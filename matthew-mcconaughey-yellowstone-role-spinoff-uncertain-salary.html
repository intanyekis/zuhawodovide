The Dallas Buyers Club actor has struggled with creative and monetary differences since he was first linked to the show.</p><p>“Paramount is dragging its feet on his $2.5 million per episode asking price — and there's a real possibility Matthew will just move on,” revealed a source, according to Life & Style.<strong><a href=#> Kevin Costner </a></strong>was paid $500,000 an episode in Season 1, but by the time Season 5 started, he was making around $1.3 million per episode.</p><p>“The expectation was that once the Hollywood strikes ended, sealing the deal would be a quick process but they're really dragging their feet on meeting his demands!”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It's not just Matthew McConaughey who is allegedly having salary issues with the upcoming spinoff. Kelly Reilly (Beth Dutton), Cole Hauser (Rip Wheeler), and Luke Grimes (Kayce Dutton) were all in dispute too. The trio, who appear in Yellowstone, weren't originally considered for the spinoff but have a pay-or-play clause in their contract for the now canceled season 6.

His demands may be sky-high, but he feels he's worth it — and the powers that be better get their act together, or he'll be saying adios, amigos!” an<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> insider revealed to the National Enquirer</a>, indicating the movie star is unlikely to back down on his demand.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The Life & Style source opened up more about the behind-the-scene problems.</p><p>“No deal Matthew has ever made has taken this long, especially after he won an Oscar for Dallas Buyers Club ."</p><p>"But Yellowstone is a monolith unto itself, and producers are wondering if it's worth it.”</p><p>Alongside monetary issues,<strong> Matthew McConaughey has also struggled with <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">creative differences with showrunner Taylor Sheridan</a></strong>. According to insiders, the actor will only agree to take part in the spin-off series if he sees the script first.</p><p>“Matthew wants to be a part of the franchise, he’s a big fan, but he wants to flesh out his character more and has other ideas of his own to pass along.
