He was also given his popular name ‘Ronaldinho’ at this age as he was usually the smallest and youngest player in the club matches.</li><li>He managed to grab nationwide attention at the age of 13 after he scored 23 goals in his side’s 23-0 victory over a local side.</li><li>In 1999, Ronaldinho announced his arrival on the national scale by humiliating World Cup-winning captain Dunga as he inspired Gremio&nbsp;in the Rio Grande do Sul State Championship final victory. In one play, he flicked the ball over Dunga’s head before speeding away, while he left him sprawling with another mazy dribble.</li><li>In 2001, the English giants Arsenal tried to bring him over to the English shores but the transfer collapsed as he couldn’t secure work permit because he was a non-EU player and hadn’t played sufficient matches for his national side.</li><li>He eventually secured a&nbsp;move to Europe by moving to the French side Paris Saint-Germain in a €5 million transfer in 2001. He had signed a five-year deal with them but would end up staying there for only 2 years.</li><li>In 2003, he moved to Barcelona FC, who managed to overcome competition from English giants Manchester United. The English side had even given him a personal tour of their facilities but it has been claimed that he was put off by English weather.</li><li>Ronaldinho’s signing by Joan Laporta was seen as a political move by some as he had failed to deliver <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>David Beckham</a> after promising Englishman’s signing during his election campaign. Ronaldinho proved much better signing than that of Beckham by Real Madrid.</li><li>He missed out most of the first half of his debut season with Barcelona due to an injury. By the mid-season, his side was languishing at the 12th position but his return galvanized his side and they managed to finish second.</li><li>In September 2005, he signed a two-year extension with Barcelona, which included a release clause of&nbsp;£85 million. They had previously offered him a contract worth&nbsp;£85 million with 9 years extension but he turned it down due to extensive length of the contract.</li><li>In November 2005, he became the second Barcelona player after legendary Diego Maradona to receive the standing ovation from Real Madrid fans at&nbsp;the Santiago Bernabéu Stadium as he led his side’s 3-0 demolition of their arch-rivals.</li><li>In 2006, he won first double that includes the league title and European title as he led Barcelona to La Liga and UEFA Champions League titles.</li><li>With growing concerns regarding his partying lifestyle and the negative effect it was having on the young prodigy <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>Lionel Messi</a>, Barcelona decided to sell him to AC Milan in July 2008. His lack of dedication to training regime had also led to his physical decline.</li><li>In May 2012, he filed a lawsuit against his side Flamengo over their failure to pay his salary for the last 4 months. He also canceled his contract with them. In his single full season with the Brazilian side, he won&nbsp;Campeonato Carioca title, Taça Guanabara title, and the Taça Rio.</li><li>In 2013, he played a monumental role in leading&nbsp;Atlético Mineiro to their first ever Copa Libertadores title. His side had also won&nbsp;Campeonato Mineiro and because of his tremendous performances, he was recognized as&nbsp;the 2013 South American Footballer of the Year.</li><li>In July 2015, Ronaldinho returned to the Brazilian soccer by signing a contract with&nbsp;Fluminense. However, in September, it was announced that he had reached mutual agreement to have his contract terminated as he wasn’t satisfied with his performances.</li><li>At the 2002 FIFA World Cup, he formed a deadly attacking partnership with Ronaldo and Rivaldo, which played a key role in leading Brazil to its record fifth World Cup title.</li><li>After his side’s disappointing performance at the 2006 World Cup, he along with Adriano were the target of Brazilian fans’ anger. The fact that he held a party at his home in Barcelona that continued into the early hours of the morning at the nightclub immediately after their exit from the tournament didn’t help the public mood.</li><li>In February 2006, he was appointed in an official role by&nbsp;UNICEF, the United Nations Children’s Fund.</li><li>In 2011, Ronaldinho was roped in by&nbsp;the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS to raise awareness about the disease amongst young people and to educate them on prevention.</li><li>In January 2018, his brother and agent confirmed that Ronaldinho was retiring from soccer.</li><li>In 2005, he captained Brazilian national side to the Confederations Cup title. He was even named Man of the Match in his side’s 4-1 victory over Argentina in the final.</li><li>In 2023, he launched a worldwide street football league called “Ronaldinho Global Street League”.</li><li>Visit his official website @ ronaldinho.com.</li><li>Follow him on <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow external" data-wpel-link=external>Facebook</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow external" data-wpel-link=external>Twitter</a>, and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow external" data-wpel-link=external>Instagram</a>.</li><p>Featured Image by&nbsp;Filipe Fortes / <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow external" data-wpel-link=external>Flickr</a> / CC BY-SA 2.0</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiglZa5tbTYnJylnZJjsLC5jqump5mcmbavtM5o</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fronaldinho.html&text=Ronaldinho%20Height%2c%20Weight%2c%20Age%2c%20Girlriend%2c%20Family%2c%20Facts%2c%20Biography&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fronaldinho.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fronaldinho.html&title=Ronaldinho%20Height%2c%20Weight%2c%20Age%2c%20Girlriend%2c%20Family%2c%20Facts%2c%20Biography" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fronaldinho.html&title=Ronaldinho%20Height%2c%20Weight%2c%20Age%2c%20Girlriend%2c%20Family%2c%20Facts%2c%20Biography" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fronaldinho.html&title=Ronaldinho%20Height%2c%20Weight%2c%20Age%2c%20Girlriend%2c%20Family%2c%20Facts%2c%20Biography" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fronaldinho.html&description=Ronaldinho%20Height%2c%20Weight%2c%20Age%2c%20Girlriend%2c%20Family%2c%20Facts%2c%20Biography" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./jk-rowling-wealth-most-expensive-purchases-things-bought.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="The Most Expensive Things J.K.
