Since his wife now works at home, that makes things much easier.</p><p class=dh><a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.today.com/popculture/jenna-bush-hager-s-husband-henry-crashes-her-chat-hoda-t182141>On Thursday</a>, <a class="me a" href=#>Jenna Bush Hager</a> and Hoda Kotb did their at-home version of "Today with Hoda & Jenna." During a segment called "Unscripted," Jenna's husband, Henry Hager, decided to pop in randomly.</p><p class=dh>Jenna answered a question a fan wrote in regarding partners sharing responsibilities with their new pet. The question brought to mind a book the host read before.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.amomama.com/c32980c448753f28328c9b22145dc8f9.jpeg><p class=zj data-testid=image-source>Jenna Bush Hager and husband Henry Chase Hager at "A Candid Conversation with Jane Fonda and Andy Cohen" on October 11, 2012, in New York City | Photo: Getty Images</p><p class=dh><strong class=bh>HENRY JOINS IN ON "TODAY SHOW"</strong></p><p class=dh>Husband Henry also read the book and overheard the topic. Viewers heard him yelling in the background as Jenna spoke to her colleague. After a few interruptions, Jenna sarcastically asked if he wanted to join.</p><p class=dh>Soon enough, Henry's face appeared next to Jenna's. He <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.today.com/popculture/jenna-bush-hager-s-husband-henry-crashes-her-chat-hoda-t182141>asked</a>: "Does anybody want to give me a haircut for Christmas?" The three laughed at the request, which Henry followed up with the suggestion of a buzzcut.</p><p class=dh>Kotb and Jenna both eagerly agreed. Jenna then went in with her hands to show how long her husband's hair had grown out during the quarantine. Henry suggested donating his locks to a charity.</p><p class=dh><strong class=bh>HENRY ADMITS TO DOING LESS CHORES</strong></p><p class=dh>Then, Jenna picked up the household duties discussion, asking Henry his opinion on how they shared theirs. The businessman <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.today.com/popculture/jenna-bush-hager-s-husband-henry-crashes-her-chat-hoda-t182141>admitted</a> that "it's probably more weighted to Jenna."</p><p class=dh>Jenna already knew this, but, she thanked her husband for acknowledging their truth and added that it makes her feel good to hear it. Soon after, Jenna dismissed her husband.</p><p class=dh><strong class=bh>MILA CRASHES HER MOM'S INSTAGRAM LIVE</strong></p><p class=dh>The couple share Mila, seven, Poppy, four, and Hal, nine months. At the <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.today.com/parents/jenna-bush-hager-s-daughter-mila-crashes-live-instagram-chat-t180540>start of May</a>, Mila was the one who acted as a party crasher when she jumped into her mom's talk with author Elizabeth Wetmore.</p><p class=dh>This time, it was during an Instagram live session titled, "Read with Jenna." The two women were discussing Wetmore's book, "Valentine," when Mila came in and whispered into her mother's ear.</p><p class=dh>Of course, Jenna's guest welcomed the cuteness overload without hesitation. During the live, Jenna <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="https://www.instagram.com/tv/B_qKLK3gHKa/?utm_source=ig_embed">joked</a> that "this is what happens when you're working from home."</p><p class=dh><strong class=bh>JENNA WAS THE FIRST TO PROPOSE</strong></p><p class=dh>Jenna is no stranger to her daughter or her husband's tendencies. She and Henry have been married since 2008. Jenna signed up for it as she was the one who first <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.oprahmag.com/entertainment/a31078231/jenna-bush-hager-husband/>proposed</a> to the brunette gentleman.</p><p class=dh>At the time, the daughter of the former president was still in her late teens — and drunk — so Henry politely declined her offer. Now they're married with three kids.</p><p class=dh><strong class=bh>JENNA SHARES FIRST FAMILY PHOTO WITH HAL</strong></p><p class=dh><a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.today.com/parents/jenna-bush-hager-shares-adorable-family-photo-baby-hal-t160597>Last August</a>, Jenna shared the sweetest family photo featuring a one-week-old Hal in a stroller looking quite pink. Everyone else wore bright smiles for the outdoor shot.</p><p class=dh>Jenna admitted that her first son caused her to be late a lot more, and to move a little slower, but she added that "life with Hal is so, so sweet." Newborns certainly have those effects.</p><p class=dh><strong class=bh>HENRY AND JENNA COME FROM A SIMILAR BACKGROUND</strong></p><p class=dh>Although <a class="me a" href=#>Henry</a> might need to foot more chores, he and Jenna share a lot in common. They both come from families with politically-inclined relatives. Henry's father is a former lieutenant governor of Virginia.</p><p class=dh>Henry himself was part of Jenna's father's presidential campaign. He was also Assistant Secretary of the Department of Education's Office of Special Education and Rehabilitation Services.</p><p class=dh>In 2007, Henry asked President Bush for his daughter's hand in marriage. The former head of the nation immediately agreed, and the pair have enjoyed their union ever since.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimlazAb63MqKSapZFjsLC5jmtncnFlbnqrsc2nmGaapai1brTAoJyrq12dwrSuwKebZqCVo7%2B6eceio5qqmaTCb7TTpqM%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2f209959-jenna-bush-hagers-husband-henry-hilariou-html.html&text=Jenna%20Bush%20Hager%27s%20Husband%20Henry%20Hilariously%20Crashes%20Her%20Chat%20with%20Hoda%20to%20Ask%20about%20His%20Haircut&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2f209959-jenna-bush-hagers-husband-henry-hilariou-html.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2f209959-jenna-bush-hagers-husband-henry-hilariou-html.html&title=Jenna%20Bush%20Hager%27s%20Husband%20Henry%20Hilariously%20Crashes%20Her%20Chat%20with%20Hoda%20to%20Ask%20about%20His%20Haircut" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2f209959-jenna-bush-hagers-husband-henry-hilariou-html.html&title=Jenna%20Bush%20Hager%27s%20Husband%20Henry%20Hilariously%20Crashes%20Her%20Chat%20with%20Hoda%20to%20Ask%20about%20His%20Haircut" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2f209959-jenna-bush-hagers-husband-henry-hilariou-html.html&title=Jenna%20Bush%20Hager%27s%20Husband%20Henry%20Hilariously%20Crashes%20Her%20Chat%20with%20Hoda%20to%20Ask%20about%20His%20Haircut" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2f209959-jenna-bush-hagers-husband-henry-hilariou-html.html&description=Jenna%20Bush%20Hager%27s%20Husband%20Henry%20Hilariously%20Crashes%20Her%20Chat%20with%20Hoda%20to%20Ask%20about%20His%20Haircut" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./kim-kardashians-plastic-surgery-denial-why-she-admitted-to-getting-botox-in-her-neck.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Kim Kardashian's Plastic Surgery Denial Is Legendary But Here's Why She Admitted To Getting Botox In">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./gateway-parks-a-neighborhood-winter-wonderland-in-eagle.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Gateway Parks: A neighborhood winter wonderland in Eagle!">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
