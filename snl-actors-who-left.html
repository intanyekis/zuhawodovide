The sketch comedy series has built a legacy around the characters and performers that have come out of its universe. The original players are some of the biggest icons from comedy and even now the series is seen as a great opportunity for fresh talent to enter the next level.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The nature of Saturday Night Live results in a large turnover in its cast.

Saturday Night Live may currently have a strong ensemble to fall back on, but there are still plenty of former cast members whose presence are greatly missed.</p><h2 id=robert-downey-jr-didn-t-get-a-chance-to-mature-with-his-comedy><span class=item-num>15 </span><span>Robert Downey Jr. Didn’t Get A Chance To Mature With His Comedy</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Saturday-Night-Live-Robert-Downey-Jr-Hosting.jpg><p>Robert Downey Jr. is now one of the biggest working movie stars and turned into the face of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Robert Downey Jr.’s star has risen in considerable ways over the past decade, but before he was much of a movie star he was cutting his teeth on Saturday Night Live.

Poehler was in no rush to leave Saturday Night Live, but it’s understandable that she was eventually eager to take on more. Parks and Recreation features Poehler’s best work, but it was still tough when she decided to exit Saturday Night Live’s cast.</p><h2 id=will-ferrell-grew-to-be-one-of-the-show-s-biggest-stars><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Will Ferrell Grew To Be One Of The Show’s Biggest Stars</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Saturday-Night-Live-Will-Ferrell-Boss.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Will Ferrell is still seen by many fans as one of Saturday Night Live best performers.

Ferrell eventually left the series to pursue a movie career and even though he’s found success in that field, somewhat of his greatest contributions to comedy are still on SNL.

Armisen has the ability to play both eccentric and mundane characters very well and he constantly pops up in projects as a wild card.
