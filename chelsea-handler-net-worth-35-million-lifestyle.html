Best known as a mainstay of television for many years, Handler was the host of her own TV show for nearly a decade. With that in mind, it makes all the sense in the world that Handler has amassed a $35 million fortune as of the time of this writing, according to celebritynetworth.com.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Of course, Chelsea Handler is far from the only celebrity who has access to a great fortune. In fact, several longtime talk show hosts have <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">a lot more money</a> than Chelsea will ever have. With that in mind, it is worth noting what Handler does with her cash in comparison to her peers.</p><p>If there is one thing that Chelsea Handler has made clear during her time in the spotlight it is this, she is more than willing to say and do things that would scare most celebrities. After all, many celebrities choose to stay silent to avoid being one of the stars <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">whose careers ended</a> after saying or doing the wrong thing. On the other end of the spectrum, Handler seems to speak her mind at every turn. Given Handler’s independent mindset, it is interesting to contemplate how she might spend her fortune.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Every U.S. Late-Night Talk Show Host Ranked By Net Worth</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=handler-s-home>Handler’s Home</h2><p>When most people imagine what they would do if they became filthy rich, one of the things they envision is owning a massive and fancy home. Based on the fact that Chelsea Handler dropped a huge chunk of change on a Bel-Air home a few years after she began hosting Chelsea Lately, she is no different in that regard.</p><p>Said to be 5,572 square feet in size, Handler’s huge home contains six bedrooms and six and a half bathrooms. When Handler bought the home in 2010, she also sunk a great deal of money into upgrades which makes sense since the house was originally built in 1964 so it likely was due for a change. Based on the pictures of Handler’s home that are out there, Chelsea turned her space into an incredibly relaxing place to live.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Once Handler passes through her impressive gates, she is met by her gorgeous grounds that are chock full of colorful plants and trees. From there, Handler can lounge by her impressive pool which is adjacent to an outdoor kitchen that sports a pizza oven, lots of seating, and relaxing lighting. Alternatively, Handler and her pals could enjoy her large terrace or the massive space that includes her living room, dining space, and the gourmet kitchen. Finally, Handler can escape to one of the many bedrooms all of which include unique features. For example, Chelsea’s main suite has a large walk-in closet, and her bathroom that features a steam shower and infrared sauna.</p><p>When Chelsea Handler initially bought her home in 2010, she reportedly <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">paid $5,942,500</a>. Based on inflation and all of the work Chelsea had done to the home, it is now worth quite a bit more. Given the fact that Handler <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">left her talk show</a> several years ago, it makes sense that in 2018 she decided to put her home on the market. As of yet, however, nobody has met Handler’s current $10.5 million asking price.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Chelsea Handler Is Back In Action With A Stand-Up HBO Show</a></span></p><h2 id=chelsea-s-lifestyle>Chelsea’s Lifestyle</h2><p>If you follow Chelsea Handler on social media, it certainly seems like she leads an incredible life and enjoys almost every minute of it. After all, she often posts images of the many vacations she takes alongside her pals. Unsurprisingly, Chelsea loves to travel and when she hits the road, it is often in style. For example, at one point she even posted an image of her dog accompanying her on a private jet on her Instagram account.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>When Chelsea Handler isn’t getting around by private jet, she travels by car just like the rest of us. Of course, Handler has a lot more money to spend on a vehicle than a lot of other people so it shouldn’t come as a surprise to anyone that she doesn’t own a cheap beater car. Instead, she spent a large amount of money on an early model Tesla. Unfortunately, Handler later wrote about losing faith in her car after seeing a video of an early model Tesla that supposedly burst into flames out of nowhere on Twitter.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">'I Was A Loudmouth': Chelsea Handler On The Book Line That Changed Her Life</a></span></p><h2 id=business-expenses>Business Expenses</h2><p>As is the case with most celebrities, Chelsea Handler has used her fortune to make a few business deals over the years. That said, Handler isn’t your typical celebrity so her <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">most notable investment</a> is in a cannabis lifestyle company called Civilized. While the amount of money Handler invested in the company is unclear, she put out a statement explaining the reasons for her faith in Civilized.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“Cannabis has made a difference in my life, in the lives of my friends and people who have been reintroduced to it. Working with Civilized, I’ve seen how passionate they are about smashing outdated cannabis stereotypes while keeping people entertained, and it’s been a real inspiration. It’s more than just a media company, it’s a movement. And one I’m proud to be a part of.”</p><p>While Chelsea Handler hopes to make money off of the deal she structured with Civilized, that hasn’t been the case with most companies she’s given her money too. After all, she has <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">supported a lot of non-profits</a> over the years. For example, Handler has a history of supporting charities like the American Foundation for AIDS Research, the Alzheimer's Association, DoSomething.org, and Stand Up To Cancer.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Chelsea Handler Says Only America 'Doesn't Believe Climate Change Is Real'</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiaoZ2cqLKieceapZ2klad6r7HTZq6oqqSdenSBjKagpaSZpLtuuMifnKysqaGycA%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fchelsea-handler-net-worth-35-million-lifestyle.html&text=How%20Comedian%20Chelsea%20Handler%20Spends%20Her%20%2435%20Million%20Net%20Worth&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fchelsea-handler-net-worth-35-million-lifestyle.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fchelsea-handler-net-worth-35-million-lifestyle.html&title=How%20Comedian%20Chelsea%20Handler%20Spends%20Her%20%2435%20Million%20Net%20Worth" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fchelsea-handler-net-worth-35-million-lifestyle.html&title=How%20Comedian%20Chelsea%20Handler%20Spends%20Her%20%2435%20Million%20Net%20Worth" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fchelsea-handler-net-worth-35-million-lifestyle.html&title=How%20Comedian%20Chelsea%20Handler%20Spends%20Her%20%2435%20Million%20Net%20Worth" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fchelsea-handler-net-worth-35-million-lifestyle.html&description=How%20Comedian%20Chelsea%20Handler%20Spends%20Her%20%2435%20Million%20Net%20Worth" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./how-much-does-it-cost-to-tune-a-piano.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="How Much Does It Cost to Tune a Piano?">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./how-much-are-niall-horans-skincare-products-that-he-uses-in-his-crazy-22-step-routine.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="How Affordable Are Niall Horan's Skincare Products That He Uses In His Crazy 22-Step Routine?">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
