He is the son of former basketball star Yao Zhiyuan.</p><p dir=ltr>The 42-year-old retired Chinese basketball player is famous for his colossal height. Ming stands at an altitude of 7 feet and 6 inches (230 cm tall approx.) It is a natural marvel for s person to be this huge.</p><p dir=ltr>However, He is still far behind the tallest man recorded in the history of humankind. Robert Pershing Wadlow, a native of Alton, Illinois, measures a mindblowing 8 feet and 11.1 inches (2.72 m), the most elevated height in human history.</p><p dir=ltr>Back to Yao Ming. He played for the Chinese Basketball league and National Basketball League (NBA) in the US. Born in Shanghai, Ming started for the Western Conference in the NBA All-Star Game eight times and has been selected to the starting lineup of the All-NBA First Team five times. Retired from the NBA, he held the record for the tallest player in the league.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=quick-facts-about-yao-ming></span>Quick Facts About Yao Ming<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Full Name</strong></td><td>Yao Ming (Chinese: 姚明)</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Age</strong></td><td>42</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Married Status</strong></td><td>Married</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Children</strong></td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Wife’s Name</strong></td><td>Ye Li</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Daughter’s Name</strong></td><td>Yao Qinlei (Amy)</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Net Worth</strong></td><td>$160 million</td></tr></tbody></table><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=does-yao-ming-have-a-son-daughter-yao-qinlei></span>Does Yao Ming Have A Son? Daughter Yao Qinlei<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Yao Ming and his wife Ye Li have one child, and it is a daughter. They do not have a son in their family.</p><p>Some people believe that when Yao Ming’s wife Ye Li was pregnant in 2009, the pair had a child who is the tallest basketball player in all of China. Moreover, some even speculated that they would have a son who would be elevated, just like his father, Yao Ming. People even were betting online on whether Yao and Ye will have a son or a daughter.</p><p>Because of China’s one-child policy back in 2009 allowed the pair to have only one child. And the baby received on May 22, 2010, came in the form of a daughter. Both their parents were overjoyed after the birth of their baby girl, whom they named Yao Qinlei.</p><p>Chinese families were only allowed one child under the country’s “one-child policy.” 1980 marked the beginning of the Chinese government’s statewide rollout of the program, which lasted until 2016. The nation’s authorities felt that the current pace of population increase was unsustainable, so they decided to implement the program to slow it down.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=how-old-is-daughter-yao-qinlei-age></span>How Old Is Daughter Yao Qinlei Age?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Yao Qinlei&nbsp;is the daughter of the retired basketball star Yao Ming and his wife, Ye Li. She was born in Houston, Texas, United States.</p><p>She is the only kid they have together, and she was born on May 22, 2010, three years after Ming and Li tied the knot in 2007. Qinlei is 12 years of age. She has been the subject of media attention since birth because her father was a well-known basketball star.</p><p>In the United States or in general, English people know her by the name Amy. She has reached an impressive height compared to her contemporaries, much like her father, who is 7 feet 6 inches tall.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=yao-ming-wife-ye-li-height-in-feet-how-tall-is-yao-qinlei></span>Yao Ming Wife Ye Li Height In Feet, How Tall Is Yao Qinlei?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Many people are curious about the height of Yao Ming’s wife, Ye Li, and whether or not she is likewise very tall.</p><p>Ming is one of the players in NBA history that holds the record for the tallest player standing at 7 feet and 6 inches, compared to his wife Ye Li, whose height is 6 feet and 3 inches (191 cm tall).</p><p>Compared to other female athletes, Ye Li is tall and can easily take advantage of her height during a game. But in front of her husband, Yao Ming, she is more than a foot shorter, 1 foot and 3 inches to be precise. The couple met in their teenage years playing college basketball in China.</p><p>Ye Li, 40, represented the Chinese national women’s basketball team at the 2004 Athens Summer Olympics.in Helliniko Arena. In 1998, when Ye was just seventeen years old, she first encountered the Chinese basketball star and her future husband, Yao Ming.</p><p>They exchanged vows on August 6, 2007, and have been married ever since. In May 2010, in Houston, Texas, Ye gave birth to their daughter Yao Qinlei, who was later named Amy in English.</p><p>Emerging from the genes of the two tallest people, Yao Qinlei has grown dramatically compared to their parents. At the age of 12, the beautiful baby girl of a former Chinese basketball player duo is already 5 feet and 8 inches tall (177 cm).</p><p>It is not possible to predict at this time how much taller she will get in the future. The young lady is twelve years old and has quite a few more years to go before she reaches her full adult height.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=how-rich-is-yao-ming-net-worth-in-2022></span>How Rich Is Yao Ming? Net Worth in 2022<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>According to&nbsp;Celebrity Net Worth, Yao Ming has accumulated a staggering $160 million net worth as of 2022.</p><p>Ming was paid $17.6 million by the Rockets for his last season, which was the biggest compensation of his whole career. It is estimated that he earned around $93 million in total pay from the NBA.</p><p>Furthermore, he has made a considerable amount of additional money through brand sponsorships and investments, and he is still making that amount now. Even though injuries forced Yao Ming’s NBA career to come to an early end, he is still considered a cultural phenomenon and has been inducted into the Hall of Fame.</p><p>The combination of his skill on the court and the advantages afforded by his upbringing enabled him to amass a significant net worth via basketball. However, unlike most other prominent athletes, Ming prefers to maintain a quiet profile.</p><p>This is despite the enormous amount of money he now has. He devotes a significant portion of his public life to assisting others who are less fortunate than himself. Ming has maintained thrift throughout his life, mainly because he is a national hero and possesses significant riches.</p><p>His last house in Houston was undoubtedly stunning; it was a 12,000-square-foot, six-bedroom mansion in Hunter’s Creek Village. However, it was hardly the most extravagant property belonging to a professional athlete. He only sometimes engages in activities related to social media. When he does, it is often to congratulate basketball players on their successes or to draw notice to the humanitarian work that he is doing.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=yao-ming-family-life-parents-and-childhood></span>Yao Ming Family Life, Parents And Childhood<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>On December 9th, 1980, Yao Ming was born in Shanghai in a family of three.</p><p>He is the only child of Yao Zhiyuan and Fang Fengdi, two of China’s most famous basketball players. Yao was much larger than the average Chinese newborn. At nine, he enrolled at a junior sports school and began playing basketball there. At the age of 13, he tried out for the junior team of the Shanghai Sharks.</p><p>In his first season playing for the senior squad, he had a scoring average of 10 points and an average of 8 rebounds. He had a foot injury during his second season, so his vertical jump was reduced to 10 centimeters.</p><p>Ming guided the Sharks to the championship game of the Chinese Basketball Association (CBA) in both his third and fourth seasons as the team’s head coach, but both times they were defeated by the Bayi Rockets. The team won their first CBA championship in Ming’s fifth season with the Sharks. Yao finished his career with Shanghai by making all 21 of his shots in the finals.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=some-faqs></span>Some FAQs<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=does-yao-ming-have-a-son></span>Does Yao Ming have a son?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>No, Yao Ming does not have a son.
