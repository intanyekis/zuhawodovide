With all the hiccups people have about the film, Hemsworth's performance is only being lauded by all. But has Hemsworth had enough of Thor? If you have seen Thor: Love & Thunder, the end credits confirm that Thor will, in fact, return to the MCU. Will that be a fifth Thor movie, or a different appearance altogether, is yet to be seen.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>However, one thing is for sure. Apart from MCU, Chris Hemsworth has got tons of other projects lined up. So for all the Hemsworth fans, here are some of his most exciting projects to look out for after Thor: Love & Thunder.</p><h2 id=will-chris-hemsworth-return-to-mcu-in-thor-5><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Will Chris Hemsworth Return To MCU In Thor 5?</span></h2><p>One of the many upcoming projects in Hemsworth's bag is yet another MCU appearance as Thor. <a href=#>But will that be Thor 5</a> or something else altogether, that is yet to be seen. Loki Season 2 is also on the way and a lot of things lead to Thor appearing in it. Due to the collapse of the Multiverse in the end of Loki Season 1, it wouldn't be that far-fetched for Loki's brother Thor to appear.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>But these are mere speculations and for all we know, Thor could also appear in the next Avengers movie. There is a lot of potential and considering the insane fan following of Hemsworth's character, Marvel doesn't seem too keen on terminating his contract anytime soon.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Chris Hemsworth Reveals His Brother Liam Almost Played Thor</a></span></p><h2 id=extraction-2-brings-hemsworth-39-s-tyler-rake-back-from-dead><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Extraction 2 Brings Hemsworth's Tyler Rake Back From Dead</span></h2><p><strong><a href=#>Netflix</a></strong>'s Extraction was a global hit, praised for its fantastic action sequences and one hell of a performance from Chris Hemsworth. The fast-paced, adrenaline-fueled flick saw Hemsworth's character presumably dying by the end. But the huge success of Extraction led to Netflix reviving Hemsworth's character for a sequel. He shared <a href=#>how the sequel is extremely different from the first film, stating it's 'very, very cold'</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=chris-hemsworth-isn-39-t-returning-in-guardians-of-the-galaxy-vol-3-quot-reportedly-quot><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Chris Hemsworth Isn't Returning In Guardians Of The Galaxy Vol. 3, "Reportedly"</span></h2><p>Guardians Of The Galaxy Vol. 3 is all set to hit the theaters in May 2023, and considering how <a href=#>Marvel's Phase 4 is looking in shambles after Thor: Love & Thunder</a>, we sure hope the Chris Pratt starrer steers the MCU back to its original glory.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">James Gunn, the director of Vol. 3, stated in a reply to a tweet,</a> "Thor was never going to be in Vol 3." However, the crew at MCU has been known to lie in order to save the biggest surprises and considering that there are going to be some amazing cameos in Vol. 3, we think that there's a high chance of even Thor showing up.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>How The Mythology Of Thor: Love And Thunder Changes The Future Of The MCU</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=the-most-awaited-prequel-to-mad-max-fury-road-features-chris-hemsworth-as-a-villain><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>The Most Awaited Prequel to Mad Max: Fury Road Features Chris Hemsworth As A Villain</span></h2><p>Chris Hemsworth doesn't often play a bad guy, but when it comes to George Miller's much-awaited Mad Max: Fury Road prequel, Furiosa, we can finally witness Hemsworth as a villain after having witnessed him as God for so long. Based on the story of the great Imperator Furiosa, the prequel follows her as she fights her trials and strives to get back to her true home.</p><h2 id=chris-hemsworth-39-s-look-in-furiosa-revealed><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Chris Hemsworth's Look In Furiosa Revealed</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Courtesy of some recent Furiosa set photos, we now also have our first look at what Chris Hemsworth in his upcoming villainous avatar. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">In a recent tweet by Film Updates</a>, Hemsworth was seen smiling in a long and heavy red beard, covered by equally long hair. Whilst we still have very few details about his role in the upcoming spin-off, one thing we know for sure is that the prequel is going to be a high-octane action mayhem.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Why WB Didn't Want Charlize Theron To Play Furiosa In 'Mad Max: Fury Road'</a></span></p><h2 id=will-chris-hemsworth-ever-return-to-the-star-trek-universe><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Will Chris Hemsworth Ever Return To The Star Trek Universe?</span></h2><p>Chris Hemsworth's one of the most prominent roles before being cast as Thor was actually in the Star Trek universe where he played George Kirk, the Starfleet officer. Hemsworth was in talks to reprise his role as Kirk in the reboot of the Star Trek film series, but he later revealed that he left the project due to an underwhelming script.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In an interview with Vanity Fair, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">he talked about the possibility of returning to the series</a>, stating, "If J.J. Abrams called me tomorrow and said: â€˜Chris Pine and I want to do it', Iâ€™d probably say: â€˜Yeah, letâ€™s go for itâ€™." So, the only thing keeping us from seeing Hemsworth in the Star Trek world again is a call from J.J. Abrams it seems.</p><h2 id=chris-hemsworth-is-inspiring-people-with-his-workout-routine><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Chris Hemsworth Is Inspiring People With His Workout Routine</span></h2><p>Chris Hemsworth has a proper Greek god body, no doubt about it. <a href=#>He reportedly eats every two hours to get in shape for Thor</a>. But now, he has taken up the responsibility of getting other people in shape as well.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>With his own personal venture called Centr, he and his team of extremely focused trainers provide the kind of training that has the potential to turn anyone into the God of Thunder. He is devoted to marketing this service on his Instagram account, and his fans have another opportunity to interact with Hemsworth, now as a workout trainer.</p><h2 id=let-39-s-talk-about-that-chris-hemsworth-cameo-in-interceptor><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Let's Talk About That Chris Hemsworth Cameo In Interceptor</span></h2><p>Chris Hemsworth recently produced an Action Drama film, Interceptor, starring his wife, Elsa Pataky. But along with producing the movie, he also made a hilarious cameo in the movie, disguised as an electronic salesman, and it completely caught the fans off-guard. He sort of resembled his Avengers: Endgame persona, flaunting long beard and a belly. After all these years, he still has a slick sense of humor.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoZmkYra0ecKhqaKrXZ2yrr%2FWqKmtoF2ZvKq6xmaYn6yVp3q1tM6rZKWnppp6orrDZquhrZ6ZsrN7</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fwhat-is-chris-hemsworth-doing-after-thor-love-and-thunder.html&text=What%20Chris%20Hemsworth%20Has%20Planned%20After%20Thor%3a%20Love%20And%20Thunder&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwhat-is-chris-hemsworth-doing-after-thor-love-and-thunder.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwhat-is-chris-hemsworth-doing-after-thor-love-and-thunder.html&title=What%20Chris%20Hemsworth%20Has%20Planned%20After%20Thor%3a%20Love%20And%20Thunder" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fwhat-is-chris-hemsworth-doing-after-thor-love-and-thunder.html&title=What%20Chris%20Hemsworth%20Has%20Planned%20After%20Thor%3a%20Love%20And%20Thunder" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fwhat-is-chris-hemsworth-doing-after-thor-love-and-thunder.html&title=What%20Chris%20Hemsworth%20Has%20Planned%20After%20Thor%3a%20Love%20And%20Thunder" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwhat-is-chris-hemsworth-doing-after-thor-love-and-thunder.html&description=What%20Chris%20Hemsworth%20Has%20Planned%20After%20Thor%3a%20Love%20And%20Thunder" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./whitney-reign.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Whitney Reign - Age, Wiki, Bio, Net Worth, Married Life, and More">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./sam-michael-fox-michael-j-foxs-son-bio-wiki-age-height-family-girlfriend-and-net-worth.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Sam Michael Fox (Michael J.
