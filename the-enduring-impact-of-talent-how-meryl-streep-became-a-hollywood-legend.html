During the early years of her career, her small yet memorable roles made a lasting impact on critics and production houses, who then offered her lead roles. With her stellar performance in every movie, she gained the reputation of being the <a href=#>finest actress Hollywood has ever seen</a>. Working in musicals and comedies showed her versatility and vocal range. Streep has many honorable accolades under her name, including being the most Academy Award-nominated actress, a total of 21 times.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>From beginning a career in drama in New York to moving to Hollywood to pursue her dreams, Meryl Streep has become an inspiration for many aspiring actresses who want to enter the field of acting.</p><h2 id=finding-stardom-through-small-roles>Finding Stardom Through Small Roles</h2><p>Starting young, Meryl Streep had already begun voice training at 12 before she took up acting during her high school years. After graduating college with a degree in drama and costume design and a Master’s in Drama from Yale, she moved to New York to pursue acting professionally. She received her breakthrough in Broadway with Trelawny of the 'Wells' in 1975. Two years after performing on Broadway, she made her movie screen debut with Julia, as noted by <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Britannica</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The following year, her small yet powerful role in The Deer Hunter as Linda earned her critics’ circle recognition. Her role as a young, soft woman <a href=#>contrasted Robert De Niro's</a> and Christopher Walken’s bravado, which deeply impacted everyone and earned her an Oscar nomination. She also worked in a television miniseries called Holocaust, for which she won an Emmy award.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=#>How Kevin Bacon Became An Icon In Hollywood</a></span></p><p>Over the next decade, Meryl Streep gave era-defining performances, which confirmed her as the best actress of her generation. According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Time</a>, in 1978, she gave a stellar performance in Kramer Vs. As a mother fighting for her child’s custody, Kramer bagged her first Oscar for her Supporting Role. She won her second Oscar for Actress in a Leading Role for Sophie’s Choice three years later.

While the movies established her as a technical actress, her name became associated with serious and dramatic roles. To break from the stereotype, she worked in a few comedy films in the 90s, including Postcards From The Edge, Death Becomes Her, and The River Wild. As the movies were not widely beloved, she returned to her Drama roots with The Bridges Of Madison County and One True Thing.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In 2003, she received her 13th Oscar nomination for Adaptation, breaking the 12-nomination record previously held by Katherine Hepburn, as stated by <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">IMDB</a>. One of her most talked-about roles occurred in 2006 when she portrayed the role of Miranda Priestley, an overbearing magazine editor in The Devil Wears Prada. Two years later, she showed her musical side playing a mother in the hit movie Mamma Mia! in 2008.</p><p>She earned critical acclaim and a Golden Globe Award for her portrayal of Julia Child in Julie And Julia and her sixteenth Oscar nomination. After starring in a romantic comedy <a href=#>opposite Alec Baldwin</a> in It’s Complicated, came her third Oscar-winning role in the 2011 Drama movie The Iron Lady, where she played the role of Margaret Thatcher, a former British Prime Minister. She also won her eighth Golden Globe with the role.</p><h2 id=a-career-that-keeps-on-giving>A Career That Keeps On Giving</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Meryl Streep continued to work in light-hearted and dramatic movies that earned her many accolades and nominations. She played a woman trying to save her marriage in Hope Springs in 2012, a razor-tongued matriarch in August: Osage County in 2013, and she received her eighteenth Oscar nomination for the latter role. She starred in the 2014 musical Into The Woods as a vengeful witch, which earned her another Oscar nomination.</p><p>After working in several drama films, she played a tragicomic character in the title role in Florence Foster Jenkins in 2016, earning her 20th Oscar nomination. Her next movie, The Post, saw her stepping into the shoes of Katharine Graham, the owner of The Washington Post and added another Oscar nomination to her name.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Along with movies, Meryl Streep turned to television and joined the cast of the critically acclaimed HBO series Big Little Lies that stars <a href=#>Reese Witherspoon</a>, Laura Dern, and Nicole Kidman.
