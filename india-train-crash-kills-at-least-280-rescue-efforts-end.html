The passenger train was “going at full speed across the station as it was not supposed to stop” there, the report said, according <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">to The New York Times</a>.</p><p>After hitting the freight train, the passenger train, which was carrying 1,257 passengers, derailed. Twenty-one of its coaches bounced off the track, with three more cars landing onto another track.</p><p>&nbsp;“Simultaneously” the Yesvantpur-Howrah Express, a passenger train with 1,039 aboard heading in the opposite direction from Bengaluru to Kolkata, was on the track that the three dislocated coaches lay. This second collision knocked the two coaches of the third train off its tracks.</p><p>Officials could not immediately say why the freight train was stopped, nor why the Coromandel Express was not alerted to its presence on the tracks.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">A school turned into a mortuary center for the bodies of the victims after the accident. <span class=credit>REUTERS</span></figure><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">A possible signal error led to the crash, according to a preliminary government report seen by Reuters. <span class=credit>REUTERS</span></figure><p>&nbsp;“By 10 p.m. [on Friday] we were able to rescue the survivors. After that it was about picking up dead bodies,” said Sudhanshu Sarangi, director of Odisha state’s fire and emergency department. “This is very, very tragic. I have never seen anything like this in my career.”</p><p>Families of the dead will receive 1 million rupees ($12,000), and the seriously injured will get 200,000 rupees, with 50,000 rupees for minor injuries, according to Railway Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw.</p><p>The accident occurred at a time when Prime Minister Narendra Modi is focusing on modernizing the British colonial-era railroad network in India, which has become the <a href=#>world’s most populous country with 1.42 billion.</a>&nbsp;</p><p>Despite government efforts to improve rail safety, <a href=#>several hundred accidents occur
