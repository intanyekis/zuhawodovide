Great comedies are few and far between now, but thankfully, in the 2010s, fans were blessed with The Hangover, a smash hit that <a href=#>gave way to several sequels</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The movie <a href=#>nearly looked a lot different</a>, with the role of Alan nearly <a href=#>being played by another hilarious performer</a>. Things, however, fell into place perfectly, and the movie was a smash hit, that helped Mike Tyson get back in the public eye.</p><p>Ed Helms' missing tooth is an iconic part of the movie, and we have the details about it below!</p><h2 id=ed-helms-got-his-breakthrough-thanks-to-the-office>Ed Helms Got His Breakthrough Thanks To The Office</h2><p>By the time season three of The Office rolled to town, the show was already established on NBC. The team behind the show wisely mixed things up by sending Jim over to Stamford, and introducing new characters into the fold. One such character was Andy Bernard, who suddenly became a permanent part of the show.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Played by Ed Helms, Andy Bernard has a lot of fans to this very day, even though his character's overall journey from season three to the show's finish line is effectively wrecked by uneven writing.</p><p>Ed Helms was not a big name when he scored the role, but he made the most of his time on screen. This is not unlike the show's original stars, who largely built their names with the show's runaway success on NBC.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">For 147 episodes</a>, Ed Helms was able to shine while on The Office, and his time on the show gave way to major opportunities in other areas of entertainment.</p><p>The Office was a fantastic place for Helms to showcase his talents and rise to fame, but his time to shine on the big screen ultimately led to him starring in one of the funniest movies of the 2010s.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>The Truth About Casting 'The Hangover'</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=the-hangover-thrived-and-turned-into-a-franchise>The Hangover Thrived And Turned Into A Franchise</h2><p>If you weren't around to see it when it debuted, then it's hard to gauge just how big of a deal The Hangover was. Simply put, this movie took the world by storm, and Ed Helms was partly responsible for its success.</p><p>Ed Helms, Bradley Cooper, Zach Galifianakis, Ken Jeong, and the rest of the cast were dynamite together in the movie, and they were able to do some incredible things with Jon Lucas and Scott Moore's script. Throw on Todd Phillips as director, and all the ingredients were there for a huge hit.</p><p>Helms played the uptight dentist, Stu, in the franchise, and while he was not the most popular character with fans, Helms was able to shine in the role. Stu was not as annoying as The Office's Andy Bernard, and he gets some development in the film that didn't ruin his entire character arc.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While that first movie is a classic with many memorable moments, a real standout occurred when Ed Helms' character woke up with a missing tooth. Some might have thought that the movie was using an effect to pull this off, but the truth is actually a lot stranger.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Here's Why Jonah Hill Passed On A Role In 'The Hangover'</a></span></p><h2 id=here-39-s-what-happened-to-his-missing-tooth-after-39-the-hangover-39>Here's What Happened To His Missing Tooth After 'The Hangover'</h2><p>So, what is the truth behind Ed Helms' missing tooth in The Hangover? Turns out, Helms had it removed for the movie!</p><p>"It is totally real. I have an implant. An adult tooth never came in and when I was 16, they did a permanent implant,"he told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">People</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>That's right, Helms' adult tooth never joined the others, leaving him with a grill that needed to be addressed.</p><p>According to Artist Dentistry, missing teeth are not as uncommon as some would believe.</p><p>"Helms' dental situation isn't that unusual. Although most of the 170 million-plus teeth missing from Americans' mouths are due to disease or trauma, a few happened because the teeth never formed," the site states.</p><p>Fortunately, it paid off later in life.</p><p>"We started to do different tests with prosthetics and blacking it out and nothing worked. I wasn’t eager to take out my implant because my mouth is healthy, but I talked to my dentist and he was like, ‘Yeah we can do it!’ My dentist was really into it," Helms revealed.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Here's What Baby 'Carlos' From 'The Hangover' Looks Like Now</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Ed Helms' missing tooth has become an iconic piece of comedy history, and it's something he will always be remembered for.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoZmkYrWivM%2BepZ6cXam8brHDZp%2BepJ2oeq610qygp59dqbywwMdmmJ%2Bslad6tbTEZp%2Bappekw6a%2Bjg%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fwhat-happened-to-ed-helms-missing-tooth-after-the-hangover.html&text=What%20Happened%20To%20Ed%20Helms%27%20Missing%20Tooth%20After%20The%20Hangover%3f&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwhat-happened-to-ed-helms-missing-tooth-after-the-hangover.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwhat-happened-to-ed-helms-missing-tooth-after-the-hangover.html&title=What%20Happened%20To%20Ed%20Helms%27%20Missing%20Tooth%20After%20The%20Hangover%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fwhat-happened-to-ed-helms-missing-tooth-after-the-hangover.html&title=What%20Happened%20To%20Ed%20Helms%27%20Missing%20Tooth%20After%20The%20Hangover%3f" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fwhat-happened-to-ed-helms-missing-tooth-after-the-hangover.html&title=What%20Happened%20To%20Ed%20Helms%27%20Missing%20Tooth%20After%20The%20Hangover%3f" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwhat-happened-to-ed-helms-missing-tooth-after-the-hangover.html&description=What%20Happened%20To%20Ed%20Helms%27%20Missing%20Tooth%20After%20The%20Hangover%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./alfred-roy-carey.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Who Is Mariah Carey's Father Alfred Roy Carey?
