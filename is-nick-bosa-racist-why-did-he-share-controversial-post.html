Because he might be selected by the San Francisco 49ers later this month, he later deleted all of the tweets.</span></p><p><span>Examining Bosa’s Instagram history revealed that he liked several posts that used the N-word and a homophobic insult. This information was discovered by the Twitter account @RzstProgramming.</span></p><p><span>The posts were from John Harrington, who went to St. Thomas Aquinas in Florida with Bosa and were published in 2014.</span></p><p><span>Harrington shared a selfie with a string of illegible hashtags, including the phrases “rape and pillage,” “N-word,” and a homophobic slur.</span></p><p><span>One of the Instagram accounts to “like” the photo was Bosa’s account,</span><span>&nbsp;nbsmallerbear</span><span>.</span></p><p><span>In a different picture from February 2014, Harrington was depicted wearing an Aquinas shirt, and the caption included the N-word and the phrases “rape and pillage.” Both Bosa and that image liked it.</span></p><p><span>In a different photo from February 2014, Harrington was pictured wearing an Aquinas shirt, and the message included the hashtag “N-word” and the phrases “rape and pillage.” That picture caught Bosa’s eye as well.</span></p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=why-did-nick-bosa-share-controversial-post></span><span>Why Did Nick Bosa Share Controversial Post?</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><span>Bosa was asked, “You previously said some insensitive things,” in a meeting room at Levi’s stadium with a team member and his parents. Do you comprehend why some people could find them offensive?</span></p><p><span>That was not my intention at all. There isn’t someplace you could be that would help you grow as much as this city will. Therefore, I believe my presence here in San Francisco is even better.</span></p><p><span>To help me develop, I’ll be surrounded by a diverse group of people. I’ll be left on my own. I’m going to mature and gain a lot of fresh knowledge.</span></p><p><span>When questioned if the tweet regarding Kaepernick was meant for him, he said it wasn’t. It’s not as if I’m defending his actions and posture; that was not what I was getting at. It was just one particular event, and I, as a young child, had a thought that came to me, and, bam, I decided to tweet it out.</span></p><p><span>Unwise choice, and I admire what he accomplished.
