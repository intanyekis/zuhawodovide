Starring Jamie Lynn Spears as Zoey, the show was based on the daily lives of kids at a fictional boarding school in Southern California — Pacific Coast Academy (PCA). The popular series lasted four seasons until they wrapped up in 2008 without a real season finale (which, many rumored it was because of Jamie Lynn Spears's teen pregnancy). But the show still has a bit of a cult following today with many '90s and 2000s babies. It also launched the career of fellow Nickelodeon star, Victoria Justice (who played Lola in the series).</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>The 10 Most Expensive Snacks In Disney World</a></span></p><p>Now that it's been almost 12 years since the show's final episode, let's take a look at what some of the cast is up to now.</p><h2 id=christopher-massey>CHRISTOPHER MASSEY</h2><p>Christopher Massey played Michael Barrett, the best friend and roommate of Chase. Massey hasn't been in much since&nbsp;Zoey 101 ended but it was just announced that he'll be in the TV series&nbsp;Accountable.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Christopher is also the brother of Kyle Massey who is also known for being in popular TV shows like&nbsp;That's So Raven.&nbsp;When Christopher isn't acting, his <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Instagram</a> account shows he's promoting a new album.</p><h2 id=kristin-herrera>KRISTIN HERRERA</h2><p>Kristin Herrera played Zoey's former roommate Dana Cruz. She was the show's resident tomboy and loved to sleep. She also had a bad attitude at times, but we didn't see too much of Dana because her character was written off after Nickelodeon thought she looked too old compared to the other kids.</p><p>Today, Kristin appears to be traveling the world and has stepped out of the acting world. According to her <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">IMDb</a>&nbsp;page, her last gig was&nbsp;Lourdes Del Torro on General Hospital for eight long seasons.</p><h2 id=matthew-underwood>MATTHEW UNDERWOOD</h2><p>Matthew Underwood played the spoiled rich boy Logan Reese. With a famous TV producer for a dad, Logan got everything he wanted and came off pretentious. Yet, despite his obvious over-compensation, Logan did well with the ladies.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>10 Weird Subliminal Messages That Are Rumored To Be In Disney Movies</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Today, Matthew is still acting and has gotten into <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">filmmaking</a> himself. He's done a few TV movies and shorts like <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Time Hoppers</a> and The Alien.</p><h2 id=erin-sanders>ERIN SANDERS</h2><p>Ah, sweet Quinn. Portrayed by Erin Sanders, Quinn was a very bright student who was part of Zoey's group of best friends. She loves experimenting with science projects and is often judged for her love of experimentation and education. Nevertheless, Zoey and co. accept her as their own.</p><p>Today, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Erin</a> is very into yoga and has ventured into writing and directing on top of acting. Since wrapping up&nbsp;Zoey 101, Erin has been in&nbsp;Mad Men, The Young and the Restless, Big Time Rush, and more recently&nbsp;Six Degrees of Separation.</p><h2 id=austin-butler>AUSTIN BUTLER</h2><p>Austin Butler's character James Garrett didn't last long on&nbsp;Zoey 101 but he sure did make an impression on Zoey. The two dated briefly but Zoey ultimately ended things when they became too serious.</p><p>Nowadays, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Butler</a> is dating Disney actress Vaness Hudgens and was just cast as the one and only Elvis Presley in an untitled project set to come out in 2021. He was also in&nbsp;The Carrie Diaries, Switched at Birth, Jonas, and a whole lot more.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=alexa-nikolas>ALEXA NIKOLAS</h2><p>Alexa Nikolas starred as one of Zoey's best friends and roommates, Nicole Bristow. She's a smart girl but gets caught up in thinking what others think of her, especially boys. However, she's a fun, quirky addition to the fun that counters Zoey's personality perfectly.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>10 Most Successful Disney Channel Stars Of All Time</a></span></p><p>These days, Alexa is working on an independent project called&nbsp;Metanoia, but she also appears to enjoy photography, music, and creative writing. Her last acting gig was in 2013 in&nbsp;an episode of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Mad Men</a>.</p><h2 id=paul-butcher>PAUL BUTCHER</h2><p>Paul Butcher played everyone's favorite TV little brother, Dustin. This sweet goofball was very smart for his age and attended the same boarding school Zoey did.</p><p>He got along nicely with Quinn and both her and Zoey were very protective of one another. Paul is still dancing with his creative side today, dabbling in both music and acting. In 2016, he starred as Brian in&nbsp;Destiny 7.</p><h2 id=victoria-justice>VICTORIA JUSTICE</h2><p>Victoria Justice is one of the more popular stars coming out of&nbsp;Zoey 101. On the show, Victoria portrayed&nbsp;Lola Martinez, one of Zoey's (and later Quinn's) roommates. She's an aspiring actress who is super confident and loves to throw herself into roles.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>10 Of The Richest Disney Stars Of 2019</a></span></p><p>Likewise, once&nbsp;Zoey 101 stopped, Victoria stayed with Nickelodeon and starred in her own show&nbsp;Victorious.&nbsp;More recently, she portrayed Harmony in&nbsp;Summer Night.</p><h2 id=sean-flynn>SEAN FLYNN</h2><p>Was the relationship between Chase and Zoey comparable to Lizzie and Gordo over on the Disney Channel? These two love birds were buddies for a long time before acting on anything.</p><p>As we know, Chase had a crush on Zoey for a long time before anything came of it. Regardless, Sean Flynn played Chase, the dorky and adorable love interest of Zoey. By the end of the series the two finally end up together but the tension between them was building throughout the four seasons.</p><p>Flynn is still acting and has also gotten into producing. He was in&nbsp;Devious Maids&nbsp;and&nbsp;The Wrong Boyfriend.</p><h2 id=jamie-lynn-spears>JAMIE LYNN SPEARS</h2><p>Jamie Lynn Spears made it big with&nbsp;Zoey 101.&nbsp;As the younger sister to pop star Britney Spears,&nbsp;this show was her time to separate herself from her famous sister. After starring as Zoey for four seasons, the show wrapped up and Jamie found herself pregnant at the age of 16.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Being a young mother put Jamie Lynn's stardom on hold but she found solace in family life. She went on to get married and have another baby with her husband but it appears she's slowly getting back into the acting world. According to her IMDb page, Jamie Lynn is currently filming for a role in&nbsp;Sweet Magnolias.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=#>10 Most Successful Nickelodeon Stars Of All Time</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmqaegYrC2uNOuqZ5nqqSyunmQaWhmr5iav6Z5wKucZqyYmsZuus6wZKOZnZ6ybrjYp6Vmq6CarrO%2Fjg%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fzoey-101-where-are-they-now-jamie-lynn-spears.html&text=Where%20Are%20They%20Now%3f%20In%20Pictures&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fzoey-101-where-are-they-now-jamie-lynn-spears.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fzoey-101-where-are-they-now-jamie-lynn-spears.html&title=Where%20Are%20They%20Now%3f%20In%20Pictures" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fzoey-101-where-are-they-now-jamie-lynn-spears.html&title=Where%20Are%20They%20Now%3f%20In%20Pictures" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fzoey-101-where-are-they-now-jamie-lynn-spears.html&title=Where%20Are%20They%20Now%3f%20In%20Pictures" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fzoey-101-where-are-they-now-jamie-lynn-spears.html&description=Where%20Are%20They%20Now%3f%20In%20Pictures" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./jesse-mccartney-fiancee-katie-peterson-what-does-she-do.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Who Is Jesse McCartney's Fiance Katie Peterson, And What Does She Do?">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./wahyu-rudi-astadi.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Wahyu Rudi Astadi">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
