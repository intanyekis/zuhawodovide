Full House was so popular that it sparked a spin-off show, Fuller House- which centers around two of the daughters-D.J. and Stephanie, their friend Kimmy (as adults) and their kids' lives. The Olsen twins did not return for the reboot, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">as they quit acting in 2011.</a> And the men of Full House had recurring roles on Fuller House.</p><p>Between scandals and <a href=#>deaths of certain cast members</a>, many net worths have changed dramatically.
