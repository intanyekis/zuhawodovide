He rose to fame in the late 1980s with his raunchy and provocative persona known as “The Diceman”. He was the first comedian to sell out Madison Square Garden for two consecutive nights in 1990, and he starred in several movies and TV shows. But how much is Andrew Dice Clay worth today, and how did he earn his fortune? Here is a brief overview of his career and net worth.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Early Life and Career</strong></h3><p>Andrew Dice Clay was born as Andrew Clay Silverstein on September 29, 1957, in Brooklyn, New York. He grew up in a Jewish family with his parents, Jacqueline and Fred, who were a real estate agent and a boxer, respectively, and his sister. He developed a talent for impressions and drums at an early age, and he performed at weddings and bar mitzvahs as a teenager.</p><p>He dropped out of college to pursue a career in comedy, and he started performing at Pips Comedy Club in Sheepshead Bay under the name Andrew Clay. He later moved to Los Angeles and began performing at The Comedy Store, where he created his alter ego “The Diceman”, inspired by Jerry Lewis and John Travolta. He stopped doing impressions and focused on his edgy and offensive style of humor, which often involved insults, profanity, and dirty nursery rhymes.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Rise to Fame and Controversy</strong></h3><p>Andrew Dice Clay gained popularity in the mid-1980s with his appearances on TV shows such as MAS*H, Diff’rent Strokes, and Crime Story. He also landed roles in movies such as Making the Grade, Pretty in Pink, and The Adventures of Ford Fairlane. He released several comedy albums, such as Dice (1989), The Day the Laughter Died (1990), and Face Down, Ass Up (2000).</p><p>However, his fame also brought him a lot of criticism and controversy. He was accused of being sexist, racist, homophobic, and vulgar by many critics, feminists, activists, and celebrities. He was banned from MTV for life after using foul language during the live broadcast of the Video Music Awards in 1989 (the ban was lifted in 2011). He also faced protests and boycotts from various groups who found his jokes offensive and harmful.</p><p>Despite the backlash, Andrew Dice Clay continued to perform and attract large audiences. He made history by selling out Madison Square Garden for two nights in a row in 1990, becoming the first comedian to do so. He also appeared on Saturday Night Live that year, but some cast members refused to appear on the show with him.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Career Decline and Comeback</strong></h3><p>Andrew Dice Clay’s career took a downturn in the early 1990s due to several factors. His movie The Adventures of Ford Fairlane flopped at the box office and received negative reviews. His comedy album The Day the Laughter Died Part II (1993) was also poorly received. He suffered from personal problems such as divorce, bankruptcy, drug addiction, and health issues. He also faced competition from other comedians who emerged in the scene, such as Chris Rock, Adam Sandler, and Jim Carrey.</p><p>Andrew Dice Clay attempted to revive his career in the late 1990s and 2000s with various projects. He starred in his own sitcom called Hitz (1997), but it was canceled after six episodes. He also appeared in movies such as Brain Smasher… A Love Story (1993), One Night at McCool’s (2001), Foolish (1999), My 5 Wives (2000), and Point Doom (2001). He released more comedy albums, such as Filth (1999) and No Apologies (2008). He also performed on stage and toured across the country.</p><p>Andrew Dice Clay made a comeback in the 2010s with more critical acclaim and recognition. He received positive reviews for his supporting roles in Woody Allen’s Blue Jasmine (2013) and Bradley Cooper’s A Star Is Born (2018). He also starred in his own reality show called Dice (2016-2017) on Showtime, which followed his life and career. He launched a podcast called I’m Ova Hea’ Now in 2018. He continues to perform stand-up comedy and act in various projects.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Net Worth</strong></h3><p>According to Celebrity Net Worth , Andrew Dice Clay has an estimated net worth of $10 million as of 2023. This is based on his earnings from his comedy albums, tours, movies, TV shows, books, merchandise, and other ventures. He has also invested in real estate properties over the years.</p><p>Andrew Dice Clay is one of the most influential and controversial comedians of all time. He has achieved success and fame with his unique style of humor, but he has also faced challenges and criticism. He has proven his resilience and versatility as an entertainer, and he remains active and relevant in the industry. He is a millionaire comedian who has made his mark in the history of comedy.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmikmZh6rrHRnJ%2BapqRjsLC5jpuss7Jfnby4ecCnm6udp2Kxqq%2FEZpqlmalir6avwKacZpldoratuMiopZqhopp6pLvMnpuimZ5k</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fhow-andrew-dice-clay-became-a-millionaire-comedian.html&text=How%20Andrew%20Dice%20Clay%20Became%20a%20Millionaire%20Comedian&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fhow-andrew-dice-clay-became-a-millionaire-comedian.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fhow-andrew-dice-clay-became-a-millionaire-comedian.html&title=How%20Andrew%20Dice%20Clay%20Became%20a%20Millionaire%20Comedian" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fhow-andrew-dice-clay-became-a-millionaire-comedian.html&title=How%20Andrew%20Dice%20Clay%20Became%20a%20Millionaire%20Comedian" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fhow-andrew-dice-clay-became-a-millionaire-comedian.html&title=How%20Andrew%20Dice%20Clay%20Became%20a%20Millionaire%20Comedian" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fhow-andrew-dice-clay-became-a-millionaire-comedian.html&description=How%20Andrew%20Dice%20Clay%20Became%20a%20Millionaire%20Comedian" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./josh-hartnett.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Josh Hartnett Partner, Spouse, Wife, Girlfriends &amp;amp; Net Worth">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./donna-kelce-gifted-taylor-swift-her-87-jersey-ring-says-designer.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Donna Kelce Gifted Taylor Swift Her 87 Jersey Ring, Says Designer">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
