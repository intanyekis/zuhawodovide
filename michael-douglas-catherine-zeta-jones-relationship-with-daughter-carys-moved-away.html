Worse yet, stars like <a href=#>Owen Wilson who are uninvolved in one of their child's lives</a> get judged even more.</p><p>Unfortunately for Michael Douglas and Catherine Zeta-Jones, they have been judged since <a href=#>their daughter claimed she was traumatized by their fame</a>. Still, Douglas and Zeta-Jones seemed to try to do the best for their daughter since they even moved for her.

Only a year later, the two gorgeous and widely respected actors walked down the aisle and they have remained married ever since then.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/michael-douglas-and-catherine-zeta-jones-when-they-were-young.jpg><p>When Douglas and Zeta-Jones first met, <a href=#>their introduction arguably was very creepy</a>. After all, Douglas once revealed during an appearance on The Jonathan Ross Show that he made a strange remark to Zeta-Jones less than an hour after they met.</p><p>"She came back after her work and we sat there for a little while and I said to her after about half an hour, 'You know, I'm going to be the father of your children.'" Even though Douglas initially thought that comment messed everything up, things obviously worked out.</p><p>Instead, Douglas' remarks became reality not too long after they walked down the aisle. The same year the actors were wed, they welcomed their son Dylan Zeta-Douglas into the world. Three years later, the happy couple had their daughter Carys Zeta-Douglas.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/michael-douglas-request-to-have-jodie-foster-as-his-sister-instead-of-daughter-caused-the-actress-to-launch-a-huge-lawsuit-worth-54-5-million.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="Michael Douglas' Request To Have Jodie Foster As His Sister Instead Of Daughter In The Game Caused The Actress To Launch A Huge Lawsuit Worth $54.5 Million">Michael Douglas' Request To Have Jodie Foster As His Sister Instead Of Daughter In The Game Caused The Actress To Launch A Huge Lawsuit Worth $54.5 Million</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>Jodie Foster was promised a major salary for The Game, but things took a turn once Michael Douglas entered the picture.</p><p>In 2019, Douglas spoke to Closer Weekly about the living situation he and Zeta-Jones had with their daughter. As Douglas explained at that time, his daughter Carys Zeta-Douglas had moved out of his home to begin attending boarding school.</p><p>Over the years, it has become known that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">several celebrities have sent their children to boarding school</a>. Some stars who sent their kids to boarding school include Paul McCartney, Keith Richards, Pamela Anderson, Madonna, Jimmy Carter, Steve Jobs, and Cynthia Nixon.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/michael-douglas-and-catherine-zeta-jones-family-photo.jpg><p>As that list makes clear, a wide array of celebrities believed sending their kids to boarding school was the best option.

I think what bothers me the most is that people think I don’t work hard for it, that I don’t need to work hard for it. That anything I do gets handed to me. When, honestly, I feel like it’s the opposite.

According to what Town & Country's writer wrote about Zeta-Douglas, she already was an impressive person by the time she turned fifteen years old.</p><p>"For Carys, tuning out such noise means tuning into her interests, which include, predictably, acting (she has been in school productions of Tommy and Spring Awakening, and she played the lead in Once on This Island) and music (she plays the piano—well). She dreams of an Ivy League education and ponders being a doctor."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/carys-zeta-douglas-photoshoot-with-a-guitar.jpg><p>After revealing that Zeta-Douglas loves acting like her parents, Town & Country's article continued to outline what made her impressive at that time. "And, really, how many 15-year-olds authoritatively discuss Italian cinematography or read biographies of the maharaja of Jaipur? Carys does, all while building toward becoming a presence in her own right."</p><p>In 2023, Grazia Daily published an updated article looking at who Zeta-Douglas had become by then. As that article revealed, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Zeta-Douglas graduated from high school in 2022</a> and has gone on to higher education. However, at this time it is unclear where Zeta-Douglas chose to further her education after high school.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGikopuYlrKtecOorKCkkah6pK3ToZyroZ6aerux05pko6eemsBuvsSlmK2hn6PAqbXPZq6irJhisaLBxqGrnqpdmK6zxdJmpKiulZl6osPAsmY%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fmichael-douglas-catherine-zeta-jones-relationship-with-daughter-carys-moved-away.html&text=Michael%20Douglas%20And%20Catherine%20Zeta-Jones%20Changed%20Their%20Lives%20For%20Their%20Daughter%20Carys%20Who%20Still%20Left&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fmichael-douglas-catherine-zeta-jones-relationship-with-daughter-carys-moved-away.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fmichael-douglas-catherine-zeta-jones-relationship-with-daughter-carys-moved-away.html&title=Michael%20Douglas%20And%20Catherine%20Zeta-Jones%20Changed%20Their%20Lives%20For%20Their%20Daughter%20Carys%20Who%20Still%20Left" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fmichael-douglas-catherine-zeta-jones-relationship-with-daughter-carys-moved-away.html&title=Michael%20Douglas%20And%20Catherine%20Zeta-Jones%20Changed%20Their%20Lives%20For%20Their%20Daughter%20Carys%20Who%20Still%20Left" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fmichael-douglas-catherine-zeta-jones-relationship-with-daughter-carys-moved-away.html&title=Michael%20Douglas%20And%20Catherine%20Zeta-Jones%20Changed%20Their%20Lives%20For%20Their%20Daughter%20Carys%20Who%20Still%20Left" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fmichael-douglas-catherine-zeta-jones-relationship-with-daughter-carys-moved-away.html&description=Michael%20Douglas%20And%20Catherine%20Zeta-Jones%20Changed%20Their%20Lives%20For%20Their%20Daughter%20Carys%20Who%20Still%20Left" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./5-most-scandalous-billion-dollar-ponzi-schemes.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="The 5 Most Scandalous Billion Dollar Ponzi Schemes">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./masika-kalysha-net-worth.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Masika Kalysha Net Worth">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
