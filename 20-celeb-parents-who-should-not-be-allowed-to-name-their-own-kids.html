Not only do they have to take care of that child and love it every step of the way, they are also left with the responsibility of having to name that child. You want your child to have a name that suits them and also a name that will not totally hate you for. A name is important. It is the first thing someone gets to know about you and it is something that you have to live with for the rest of your life. Unless you want to go through the process of legally changing it.</p><p>Everyone wants a different and unique name because no one wants to be the same as everyone else. With so many babies being born every year, it is hard to find a name that you do not hear often. Celebrities are notorious for picking names that no one would ever think of naming their child, simply because they are names that do not even sound like names.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Celebrity parents such as<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> Kim Kardashian </a>and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Kanye West</a> and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Kim Zolciak</a> and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Kroy Biermann </a>have all named their babies things you would never imagine and should probably never name another baby again. Here are 20 celeb parents who should no longer be allowed to name their own kids.</p><h2 id=audio-science-clayton-shannyn-sossamon>Audio Science Clayton (Shannyn Sossamon)</h2><p>American actress and musician, Shannyn Sossamon, dated Dallas Clayton, a well-known children's book illustrator from 2002 to 2004. During that time, the two had a son together, who they named Audio Science Clayton, in 2003.&nbsp; Sossamon admitted that she was not ready to be a mother and surely, that is why her son's name sounds more like something you would major in&nbsp;at school than&nbsp;a child's name. However, she believes that since becoming a mother, she has become a better person and it has also made her become a better actress. Audio is not the only child she has, Sossamon had a second child with a man she was in a committed relationship with and named her second son Mortimer.</p><h2 id=north-west-kim-kardashian-west-and-kanye-west>North West (Kim Kardashian-West And Kanye West)</h2><p>In 2013,&nbsp;when Kim and Kanye welcomed their first child, rumors sparked that the couple had named their baby North. They originally denied the rumor, however, after being told numerous times that the name was genius, the two decided to just make it official and named their daughter North West. Yes, North West as in the direction.&nbsp; Kim and Kanye went on to have two more children. The next child was a son, who they named Saint and&nbsp;most recently, they welcomed a baby girl via surrogate, named Chicago. As cute as these names may sound, they are names that celebrity children can get away with.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=sno-filmon-dot-com-cozart-chief-keef>Sno Filmon Dot Com Cozart&nbsp; (Chief Keef)</h2><p>The rapper, Chief Keef, took marketing to a whole other level when he named his child after his record label. The rapper, whose real name is Keith Cozart, named his son Sno Filmon Dot Com Cozart in an attempt to promote his new album that was being&nbsp;released later that year. However, since naming his son, there have been questions surrounding the paternity of the child, which led FilmOn.com to retract the child's right to the name. If this is not a sign that you should not have named your child after your record label...what is? However, if you only focus on the name Sno it's actually kind of cute. Sno is different but without being&nbsp;bizarrely different.</p><h2 id=apple-gwyneth-paltrow-and-chris-martin>Apple (Gwyneth Paltrow And Chris Martin)</h2><p>In 2002, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Gwyneth Paltrow</a> met the Coldplay band member, Chris Martin, and&nbsp;after just a year of dating, the two got married. The following year, the couple welcomed their first child, a daughter, who they named Apple...as in the fruit. Paltrow explained that she named her daughter Apple because it sounded sweet. She also stated that apples are very symbolic and biblical. Two years later, the couple welcomed another child, a son named Moses. Paltrow named her son Moses after a song that her husband wrote for her before their wedding. The couple is no longer together but that&nbsp;does not change the fact that they have two children together with ridiculous names. We suppose Apple is better then, let's say, Banana or&nbsp;Rambutan or Durian.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=sage-moonblood-and-seargeoh-sylvester-stallone>Sage Moonblood And Seargeoh (Sylvester Stallone)</h2><p>Well-known for his role as Rocky Balboa in the Rocky series, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Sylvester Stallone</a> is no stranger when it comes to naming children. The actor has been married three times and has five children, who all have names starting with the letter "S."&nbsp; Stallone married his first wife in 1974 and had two children named Sage Moonblood and Seargeoh, two names that were almost unheard of. When the couple divorced, he married his second wife although, the couple did not have any children. While Stallone was married to his third wife, they had three daughters named Sophia, Sistine,&nbsp;and Scarlet. It is safe to say that the sons got the short end of the stick when it came to being named by Stallone.</p><h2 id=zolten-and-moxie-crimefighter-penn-jillette>Zolten and Moxie CrimeFighter (Penn Jillette)</h2><p>A man of many traits, Penn Jillette is mostly known for being an American magician and illusionist. He is also the father of two children&nbsp;with some extremely unique names. Jillette&nbsp;and his wife, Emily, named their kids Zolten and Moxie CrimeFighter. With a name like Moxie CrimeFighter, his child is definitely born to do great things like fight crime and keep the community safe. Maybe his child will become a police officer or some profession of that nature.&nbsp;A name like Zolten sounds like a superhero in a comic book. Like Zolten sounds like he will grow up to be a quirky CEO of a major company who likes to don a mask at night and fight crime. Yeah, he's the next Batman.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=pilot-inspektor-riesgraf-lee-jason-lee-and-beth-riesgraf>Pilot Inspektor Riesgraf-Lee (Jason Lee And Beth Riesgraf)</h2><p>The actor, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jason Lee</a>, and the actress, Riesgraf, were in a relationship from 2001 to 2007. The couple was engaged to be married, however, they never&nbsp;made it down the aisle. During their relationship, the couple welcomed a son named Pilot Inspektor Riesgraf-Lee. The couple certainly did not take the traditional route when it came to naming their child. With a name like Pilot Inspektor, their child can only be one of two occupations in life, a pilot or an inspector of some sort. I guess that would make his life easier when picking something to study in school. That is definitely a name no one will forget.</p><h2 id=denim-cole-and-diezel-toni-braxton-and-keri-lewis>Denim Cole And Diezel (Toni Braxton And Keri Lewis)</h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Toni Braxton</a> and Keri Lewis are both in the music industry and met while on tour together. The two got married in 2001 and welcomed their first child together shortly after. They named their son Denim Cole Braxton-Lewis. The couple never explained the reasoning for naming their child Denim but one can only assume that the couple loves their jeans. Who would not want to be named after a great pair of pants? The couple also welcomed in a second son, who they named Diezel, which was another unique name for the family. The couple unfortunately ended their relationship in 2013 when they got a divorce.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=future-zahir-wilburn-ciara-and-future>Future Zahir Wilburn (Ciara And Future)</h2><p>Because they were both in the music industry, it seemed like <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Ciara </a>and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Future </a>were meant to be together. The couple was engaged to be married and welcomed their first child together in 2014. Ciara and Future named their son after the rapper's stage name, Future Zahir Wilburn. However, after Future was born the couple called it quits. Surly Ciara keeps the fact that she named her son Future in the past, as she is now married to the Seattle Seahawks quarterback, Russell Willson. The two got married and welcomed a daughter and opted for a more&nbsp;traditional name, Sienna. However, they did give their daughter a cute middle name, Princess.</p><h2 id=honor-jessica-alba-and-cash-warren>Honor (Jessica Alba And Cash Warren)</h2><p>The actress, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jessica Alba,</a> met the actor, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Cash Warren</a>, during the filming of Fantastic Four.&nbsp;The two got married in 2008 and have two children together. The pair welcomed two daughters, Honor and Haven, and son, Hayes. By naming their firstborn Honor, I guess they wanted to name their child after a quality they hope their child embodies. Installing the quality of honor from birth is a good idea to make sure they practice it. Nice move guys! It is also notable that the pair&nbsp;has named all of their children names beginning with the letter "H." The other two names are not too far out there but they are definitely not names you hear every day.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=kroy-kash-kais-and-kane-kim-zolciak-and-kroy-biermann>Kroy, Kash, Kais And Kane (Kim Zolciak And Kroy Biermann)</h2><p>The American television personality, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Kim Zolciak</a>, has two daughters from previous relationships, Brielle and Ariana. The two have pretty normal names but that cannot be said for this housewife's other four children. In 2011, the American football player, Kroy Biermann, and Zolciak got married. They have since had four children together, Kroy, Kash,&nbsp;and twins, Kaia and Kane. To keep up with the K's, Zolciak named her son Kash with a "K" and not a "C." I guess Zolciak named her son after something she has a lot of, meaning money. The businesswoman has made a great living for herself, as she started her own skin-care products called Kashmere Kollection. Like the Kardashians, Zolciak loves her K's.</p><h2 id=moroccan-and-monroe-mariah-carey-and-nick-cannon>Moroccan And Monroe (Mariah Carey And Nick Cannon)</h2><p>While shooting her music video, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Mariah Carey </a>met <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Nick Cannon</a> and the two got married in 2008. The two welcomed in twins a boy and a girl, Moroccan and Monroe. Naming your child Monroe is not something we have not heard before but the name Moroccan is definitely something we have never heard before. It should come as no surprise that the diva, Mariah Carey, would name her children something unique and different. The couple called it quits in 2014. It would be interesting to know if Moroccan's nickname is Morocco and if he has ever been to the country.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=rebel-racer-rocket-rhiannon-and-rogue-robert-rodriguez>Rebel, Racer, Rocket, Rhiannon, and Rogue (Robert Rodriguez)</h2><p>Sticking with names that start with an "R," the filmmaker,<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> Robert Rodriguez,</a> has five children who have names that start with an "R," none of which are typical. His five children's names are Rebel, Racer, Rocket, Rhiannon, and Rogue. With a name like Rebel, we can assume Rodriguez thinks his first born son is going to be a wild child and he hopes that his second, Racer, will become a race car driver. I can only imagine calling out your children and having to go through the whole list before you call the right name. On the bright side, Rodriguez's family all have the same initials.</p><h2 id=story-jenna-elfman-and-bodhi-elfman>Story (Jenna Elfman And Bodhi Elfman)</h2><p>Best known for her roles in television comedies, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jenna Elfman</a> met her husband at a Sprite commercial audition. The couple got married in 1995 and had their first child together, a son named Story. We can only imagine that there is a great story behind the naming of their child, however, if there is not one I am sure they will make one up. No one names their child Story without having a good story to back it up. The couple also has another son,&nbsp;who they named Easton. There is always a story behind a name, which tells why the name was chosen, but I guess if there is not a story, you just name your child Story.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=sunday-nicole-kidman-and-keith-urban>Sunday (Nicole Kidman And Keith Urban)</h2><p>Why would someone name their child after the day of the week that everyone hates, Sunday? <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Nicole Kidman</a> and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Keith Urban</a> welcomed a baby girl in 2008 and named her Sunday. However, not after the day of the week, but after Sunday Reed. Reed is seen as a key mover in the arts and struck the couple as a perfect name for a woman. I wonder if she will grow up hating Sundays or loving them?&nbsp; The couple also has another daughter named Faith. Surely, the Urban family&nbsp;is keeping Sundays holy. Although Sunday is probably the least harmless name on this list. Remember the character Wednesday from Adam's Family? The name is a little&nbsp;odd but it fits her so well! So, maybe little Sunday will grow into her name one day too.</p><h2 id=kyd-david-duchovny-and-tea-leoni>Kyd (David Duchovny And Tea Leoni)</h2><p>The actor, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">David Duchovny</a>, and the actress, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Tea Leoni</a>, got married in 1997 and have two children together. They named their daughter Madelaine and their son, Kyd. Picking a name for your child can be very difficult, it is a huge responsibility. You want your child to have a unique name that is not often heard but at the same time, you do not want your child to hate you for the name you have given them. To keep things safe, Duchovny and Leoni named their son Kyd. Just to make it seem less obvious that they named their kid, Kyd, they changed the "i" to a "y." They took the easy route and named their child exactly what he is, a kid.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=birdie-and-cricket-busy-philipps-and-marc-silverstein>Birdie And Cricket (Busy Philipps And Marc Silverstein)</h2><p>Known for playing the role of "Karen" in the movie White Chicks,&nbsp;Busy Philipps married the screenwriter,&nbsp;Marc Silverstein. The two got married in 2007 and a year later, welcomed their first daughter, Birdie. When Phillips and Silverstein welcomed their second child, it was apparent that the couple had a thing for naming their children after animals. They named their second daughter Cricket. They named their daughter after those annoying small summer bugs that make a lot of noise at night so hopefully, this is not a representation of the kind of child her parents think she is.</p><h2 id=poppy-honey-daisy-boo-petal-blossom-rainbow-buddy-bear-and-river-rocket-dallas-blue-jamie-oliver-and-juliette-norton>Poppy Honey, Daisy Boo, Petal Blossom Rainbow, Buddy Bear, And River Rocket Dallas Blue (Jamie Oliver And Juliette Norton)</h2><p>The celebrity chef, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jamie Oliver</a>, married his wife, Juliette Norton, in 2000 and since then, the couple has had five children, all with unique names. The family of seven includes Poppy Honey, Daisy Boo, Petal Blossom Rainbow, Buddy Bear, and River Rocket Dallas Blue. It is hard to believe that these are the names of Oliver's children. Some of the names are a mouth full. I can only imagine how hard it was to remember all their names. Each child must have a nickname that they prefer to be called. We can't even imagine what the couple would name their next child. It must be hard for his kids to find their names on a mug or a keychain.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=kingston-james-zuma-nesta-rock-and-apollo-bowie-gwen-stefani-and-gavin-rossdale>Kingston James, Zuma Nesta Rock, And Apollo Bowie (Gwen Stefani And Gavin Rossdale)</h2><p>In 2002, the singer, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Gwen Stefani</a>, and the lead singer of the Goo Goo Dolls, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Gavin Rossdale</a>, got married. They had three sons, Kingston James, Zuma Nesta Rock, and Apollo Bowie. These are all names that we do not hear on the daily bases and names that we may never understand. Unfortunately, their marriage did not last and the famous couple got a divorce in 2015. These&nbsp;unusual names will definitely make these children stand out but when your parents are celebrities, having an unusual name is&nbsp;pretty much the norm. I mean when your parents are literally rockstars you're life will never be truly normal, so your name might as well be a little out there too. Why would rockstars want to name their kids Brad or Jenny or John?</p><h2 id=heaven-love-on-stone-and-god-iss-love-stone-lil-mo>Heaven Love'on Stone And&nbsp;God'iss Love Stone&nbsp;(Lil' Mo)</h2><p>Cynthia Karen Loving is well known for being an R&B singer under the stage name Lil' Mo. In 2001, Lil' Mo met her first husband. After only dating for five months, the two got married and only a year later, they welcomed their first daughter, Heaven Love'on Stone. After only a few years later, Lil'Mo welcomed her second daughter, God'iss Love Stone. At a first glance, these names may&nbsp;look weird, but because of their pronunciation, these names are actually very beautiful and unique. When you see God'iss Love you think it says God is love, but with the apostrophe, it is one word pronounced "Goddess." I mean most parents think their children are perfect and miraculous creations. But to go so far as to give them such biblical names?
