From there, fans have seen how the sock designer has adjusted to life in Hollywood and <a href=#>how his body has changed over the years</a>.</p><p><a href=#><strong>Kris Jenner</strong></a>’s only son has experienced fluctuating weight during his adult life. His weight gain began in the early 2010s, during which he posted a throwback photo in August 2015 that claimed that it “started right here with these milkshakes.” The image Kardashian shared was taken in 2011 when he boasted a slimmer look at the Sugar Factory American Brasserie in Las Vegas.</p><p>Though he’s worked hard to slim down after his initial gain, he’s often struggled to keep the weight off. He also retreated from the cameras and his public appearances became a rarity.</p><p>“I think he’s just going through a phase where he’s not comfortable in his own skin,” Rob’s big sister <a href=#><strong>Kim Kardashian</strong></a> explained on Today in 2015. “He is working really hard to get back to where he really wants to be.”</p><p>The KKW Beauty mogul said that she doesn’t “necessarily think” his struggles are linked to fame. Rather, she believes it’s tied to “circumstances in his life that he just really hasn’t dealt with” over time.</p><p>“Whether it’s, you know, the loss of our father, or certain breakups or, you know, he was extremely close to <a href=#><strong>Lamar [Odom]</strong> </a>and when, you know, <a href=#><strong>Khloé [Kardashian]</strong> </a>and him broke up, that was really hard on him,” she explained. “So, I think it was a couple things.”</p><p>Rob was hospitalized in December 2015 after being diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes six months earlier. He had another diabetes-related hospitalization the year after.</p><p>The E! personality welcomed daughter, Dream, in 2016 with his ex-fiancée <a href=#><strong>Blac Chyna</strong></a>. During his relationship with the Real Blac Chyna star, <a href=#>he credited her via Instagram as his “motivation”</a> to continue losing weight. In that same post, he claimed to have gone from 298 to 248 pounds.&nbsp;(The former pair were engulfed in <a href=#>a messy child custody battle</a> nearly three years <a href=#>after their 2017 split</a>.)</p><p>In June 2019, Rob revealed that he was <a href=#>continuing forward with his fitness regimen</a> after partaking in a gym day. Months later, he made headlines after <a href=#>debuting a slimmer figure</a> while posing with his mother in their Halloween costumes. He <a href=#>showed off a thinner frame once again</a> in June 2020, during which he <a href=#>made an appearance</a> at sister Khloé’s 36th birthday celebration.</p><p>The following year, Khloé <a href=#>revealed that her brother was dating again.</a></p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“I know Rob is feeling really good about himself and he’s working really hard on himself, and so I think before he did something like this, where he has to address probably the part that made him want to take a break, [he can start fresh],” she explained during the Keeping Up With the Kardashians reunion in June 2021.</p><p>Scroll down to see Rob’s body evolution through the years.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZJunlK58sbXCrayrnaNkv7CujKSYq5yRqLWqrc2sZJunlK56psLOpaytoZ%2BjerW00aisoKBdqbWmediemKurXw%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2frob-kardashians-body-evolution-through-the-years.html&text=Rob%20Kardashians%20Body%20Evolution%20Through%20the%20Years&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2frob-kardashians-body-evolution-through-the-years.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2frob-kardashians-body-evolution-through-the-years.html&title=Rob%20Kardashians%20Body%20Evolution%20Through%20the%20Years" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2frob-kardashians-body-evolution-through-the-years.html&title=Rob%20Kardashians%20Body%20Evolution%20Through%20the%20Years" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2frob-kardashians-body-evolution-through-the-years.html&title=Rob%20Kardashians%20Body%20Evolution%20Through%20the%20Years" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2frob-kardashians-body-evolution-through-the-years.html&description=Rob%20Kardashians%20Body%20Evolution%20Through%20the%20Years" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./cory-booker.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Who is the Democratic Senator, Cory Booker Dating?
