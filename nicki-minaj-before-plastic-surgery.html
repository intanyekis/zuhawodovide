She grew up in a violent environment with a drug-addicted father who eventually reformed after entering rehab and beginning to attend church. Minaj studied singing and acting at LaGuardia High School.</p><p>Young Money’s CEO first noticed her and later recruited her for The Carter Edition of Young Money’s own “The Come Up” DVD series.

We’re here to observe how she’s developed in more ways than one, from Red Lobster waitress to gorgeous Hip Hop legend. Here’s a timeline that demonstrates some significant changes since her big break in 2009, complete with photos to back it up!</p><h3><strong>1. Nose Job (2009)</strong></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/thecurrent-online.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Nose-Job.jpg><p>Nicki has always had a sharp nose, based on earlier images, but why does it appear thinner now? She attributes it to the contouring’s power! She addressed the concerns head-on in a 2013 interview with Extra’s Renee Bargh.</p><p>“They’ll notice the contour and assume you had nose surgery, but look at ‘RuPaul’s Drag Race’ to see how you can make your nose seem any shape you want.” People assume I’m doing insane things to my skin when they see my makeup, but it’s just cosmetics.”</p><h3><strong>2. Teeth&nbsp;&nbsp;Surgery (2010)</strong></h3><p>She was more than pleased to show off her dazzling whites on the red carpet when her Pink Friday album was released! In an interview with The Guardian, she was asked if her teeth were natural, and she responded by asking, “Are your teeth natural?” Most likely, she’s had veneers placed in her teeth to give her that megawatt grin!</p><h3>3. The Booby Surgery (2010 – 2017)</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/thecurrent-online.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/The-Booby-Surgery.jpg><p>Nicki’s boobs have gotten larger and larger over the years, prompting some to suspect she’s had multiple breast enhancement procedures. If you look at her images and videos from the last decade, you’ll notice that they always seem to defy gravity! Nicki hasn’t said anything about it, but her provocative photographs speak for themselves.</p><h3>5. Implants for the Butts (2010 – 2015)</h3><p>Her assets are so massive that they’ve caused her a slew of wardrobe mishaps and difficulty fitting into outfits! Her butt “exploded” once, according to TMZ, as she was performing on stage at one of her gigs. What a disappointment!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/thecurrent-online.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Implants-for-the-Butts.jpg><p>Nicki hasn’t spoken about implants since then, but Beverly Hills surgeon Dr. David Feldmar gave Radar his two cents. “It does look that she’s had some form of gluteal augmentation.” It appears that she had abdominal implants or received fat injections.”</p><h3><strong>6. Hip Surgery (2016)</strong></h3><p>Nicki’s 5’2″ size makes her appear small, and her legs appear to be proportionately thinner than the rest of her body. She may have shifted fat into the sides of her hips to give her curvy body a lift to balance out her ratios with the junk in her trunk!</p><h3>7. Botox (2017 – 2019)</h3><p>Nicki, who is now in her mid-thirties, appears to be wrinkle-free! Does she have a secret skin-care routine that we’re not aware of? Perhaps not. Some speculate that Nicki has a facelift with the use of fillers, which would explain why her skin is so beautiful!</p><h3>Nicki has gotten a lot of attention on Twitter.</h3><p>When Nicki tweeted about her father performing surgical procedures on the Barb, she was slammed by an anonymous account known only as @LittoThot. All of this sounds awful, but we’re skeptical of her wild claims. The deceptive tweet, however, did not deter admirers from obsessing over the trending issue on Twitter.</p><p><strong>Read More: </strong><a href=#>Selling Sunset Star Christine Quinn Before And After Pictures: Looking Better Than Ever</a></p><h2><strong>Nicki Minaj’s Personal Life</strong></h2><p>In the year 2000, Minaj began dating rapper Safaree Samuels.
