Everyone was shocked to learn the news, especially Stause’s <strong><a href=#>Selling Sunset</a></strong> co-stars as they were kept in the dark before the reveal. People were specifically surprised because of Chrishell Stause’s desire to start a family as soon as possible, which ultimately caused her breakup with Jason Oppenheim.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While that desire still lives strong in Stause, she has spoken out about how G Flip has opened her mind to more possibilities. She explained on Selling Sunset’s reunion episode how there are other ways to have children and love can come from anywhere, any time. Stause and G Flip are defying age gaps and gender norms, so let’s get into exactly what makes them so special.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>'Selling Sunset': Why Chrishell Stause And Jason Oppenheim Didn't Film Their Breakup</a></span></p><h2 id=who-is-g-flip><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Who Is G Flip?</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Fans have a lot of questions about Chrishell Stause’s new partner. G Flip, whose full name is Georgia Flipo. They are an extremely talented musician from Australia and play many instruments as well as sing. They are most known for their songs “About You,” “Drink Too Much,” and “GET ME OUTTA HERE.”</p><p>G Flip is non-binary and goes by they/them pronouns. Stause stated on Selling Sunset that she is attracted to masculine energy and that she is drawn to the personality of someone rather than their physical appearance. G Flip's energy clearly fit the bill for Stause as they are now happily in a relationship.</p><h2 id=how-did-g-flip-and-chrishell-meet><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>How Did G Flip And Chrishell Meet?</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>G Flip and Stause met on set. Flipo cast Chrishell in their most recent music video for “GET ME OUTTA HERE.” Stause spoke on Selling Sunset about how excited she was to act again after taking such a long break from soap operas. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The two got hot and heavy while filming</a>, so it is no surprise their chemistry grew into something more.</p><p>The video and song are now streaming on all platforms, giving viewers an inside peak into their beginning. Their public displays of affection continue on their Instagram pages and in adorable paparazzi photos. These two can't seem to get enough of each other!</p><h2 id=how-old-is-georgia-flipo-and-how-old-is-chrishell><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>How Old Is Georgia Flipo (And How Old Is Chrishell)?</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>G Flip is only 27! This is a big change for Chrishell Stause. Previously, Stause had only dated people closer to her age, such as Justin Hartley and Jason Oppenheim. As a 40-year-old woman, Stause is at a very different stage in her life than G Flip. Stause is looking to settle down and have a family, and fans worry G Flip is still enjoying their roaring twenties. However, this large age gap does not seem to affect the happy couple. After all, age is just a number. The two appear hopelessly in love and on the same page with what they want.</p><h2 id=chrishell-and-justin-hartley-split-in-2021><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Chrishell And Justin Hartley Split In 2021</span></h2><p>Chrishell Stause’s famous break-up was in the public eye when Justin Hartley filed for divorce back in November 2019. Selling Sunset showcased the incident and its fallout, which was just as shocking to Stause as it was to fans of the couple.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Fans were very surprised to learn that Hartley did not give Stause any warning before filing for divorce and sharing the news with TMZ. Hartley seems to have completely moved on from the split and <a href=#>does not have anything to say about Stause or her new relationship</a>. He is keeping his feelings and new life private.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Chrishell Stause's Richest Ex Is Worth An Absolutely Obscene Amount Of Money</a></span></p><h2 id=jason-oppenheim-supports-chrishell-stause-and-g-flip><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Jason Oppenheim Supports Chrishell Stause And G Flip</span></h2><p>Fans of Selling Sunset were heartbroken to hear of Chrishell Stause and Jason Oppenheim’s split at the end of season 5 of the show. Co-stars were rooting for them to end up together, but Oppenheim’s decision to not have children resulted in their breakup.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=#>Oppenheim was one of the first to show support for Stause</a> and G Flip and has continued to stand by Stause’s side.

The relationship was previously kept secret, even from Stause’s close friends on Selling Sunset.</p><p>Maya Vander’s reaction to the news was priceless but full of love for her friend's newfound happiness. Stause was immediately met with overwhelming support from her fellow cast mates, as well as fans on social media. Stause has since taken to Instagram to further share her experience and give eager viewers a little more context on her relationship with G Flip.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>The Truth About Why Matthew Morrison Broke Up With Chrishell Stause</a></span></p><h2 id=chrishell-and-g-flip-share-a-home><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Chrishell And G Flip Share A Home</span></h2><p>Viewers got to watch Chrishell Stause’s process of buying a home last year on Selling Sunset. Her fellow cast mate Amanza Smith helped her decorate the space and turn it into Stause’s dream home. Now, Stause gets to share her home with someone she loves.</p><p>After the couple posted multiple photos and videos to social media in Stause’s home, rumors circulated that the two were sharing the beautiful house in the hills. A source told People that “<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Chrishell moved them in</a>.” The two are making a life together, and fans could not be happier about it.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=does-g-flip-want-a-family-with-chrishell-stause><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Does G Flip Want A Family With Chrishell Stause?</span></h2><p>It is no secret Chrishell Stause wants kids. She ended her relationship with Jason Oppenheim because of her desire to start a family. Since dating G Flip, Stause has been open about having children in other ways such as adoption and very vocal about how this relationship does not prevent her from having children.</p><p>Despite their age, G Flip is on board with having kids. They spoke in an episode of the People Every Day Podcast about children, saying “<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">I definitely see children in my future</a>.” They also pointed out that “two people who have the same sex organs can still have children,” so adoption might be in the couple’s future!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>Inside Chrishell Stause And Jason Oppenheim's Awkward Work Relationship, Post-Split</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuobFdmLWztdKhnKWkXajBosHSnqpmqpWhrrW1zqefoqhdrLa1tIygZJ%2BkmaV6qr%2BMrKeem5mWuXA%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fwhy-chrishell-stauses-relationhip-with-g-flip-is-special.html&text=Why%20Chrishell%20Stause%27s%20Relationhip%20With%20G%20Flip%20Is%20Special&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwhy-chrishell-stauses-relationhip-with-g-flip-is-special.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwhy-chrishell-stauses-relationhip-with-g-flip-is-special.html&title=Why%20Chrishell%20Stause%27s%20Relationhip%20With%20G%20Flip%20Is%20Special" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fwhy-chrishell-stauses-relationhip-with-g-flip-is-special.html&title=Why%20Chrishell%20Stause%27s%20Relationhip%20With%20G%20Flip%20Is%20Special" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fwhy-chrishell-stauses-relationhip-with-g-flip-is-special.html&title=Why%20Chrishell%20Stause%27s%20Relationhip%20With%20G%20Flip%20Is%20Special" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwhy-chrishell-stauses-relationhip-with-g-flip-is-special.html&description=Why%20Chrishell%20Stause%27s%20Relationhip%20With%20G%20Flip%20Is%20Special" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./20-things-only-j-los-personal-trainer-can-tell-us-about-her-lifestyle.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="20 Things Only J-Lo's Personal Trainer Can Tell Us About Her Lifestyle">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./these-pics-show-just-how-much-taylor-swifts-style-has-evolved.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="These Pics Show Just How Much Taylor Swift's Style Has Evolved">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
