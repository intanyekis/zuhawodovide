While she maintains that she did not go under the knife, she does admit to trying out non-invasive laser skin treatments such as vampire facials and occasionally receiving Botox injections.</p><p>She also revealed that she has opted for laser hair removal on her face and, following her pregnancy, she underwent nonsurgical procedures to remove stretch marks and tighten her belly button. Recently, in a sneak peek of The Kardashians' season 3, shared on Khloé's Snapchat, the beauty mogul openly admitted to receiving Botox injections in her neck.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=why-did-kim-kardashian-admit-to-getting-botox-in-her-neck>Why Did Kim Kardashian Admit to Getting Botox in Her Neck?</h2><p>Kim Kardashian recently made a candid admission about her involvement in a technique called #TrapTox according to Hypebae, which involves receiving Botox injections in the neck area. The revelation came to light in a sneak peek of the upcoming third season of The Kardashians, shared by Khloé Kardashian on Snapchat.</p><p>In the preview, Kim is shown participating in voice lessons alongside her sisters as part of their album recording process.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/did-kim-kardashian-try-to-bribe-the-mayor-of-l-a-_-here-s-the-truth-about-the-swag-bag-sent-from-skims.jpg><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">During the singing lesson</a>, their vocal coach mentioned using neck muscles.

This light-hearted exchange brings to the surface a previously undisclosed aspect of her life.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The purpose of Botox injections in the neck is to temporarily paralyze the muscles, resulting in reduced wrinkles and fine lines. This disclosure comes at a time when Kylie Jenner and the rest of the family are seeking to address the concept of beauty standards and share their perspectives on how they feel and how society has perceived them about these established norms.</p><h2 id=kim-kardashian-39-s-denial-of-plastic-surgery-procedures-sparked-criticism>Kim Kardashian's Denial Of Plastic Surgery Procedures Sparked Criticism</h2><p>Kim Kardashian faces criticism from fans who feel she hasn't been honest about her alleged plastic surgeries. The controversy emerged after her interview with Allure, where the SKIMS founder discussed her secrets for maintaining a youthful appearance. Some fans were disappointed by the lack of detailed information regarding her plastic surgeries, and this ignited a wave of backlash on social media.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/2-16.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Anika Reed, an editor at USA Today, expressed her frustration on Twitter, stating that not questioning Kardashian further about her procedures beyond Botox was irresponsible. Others echoed similar sentiments, with one person highlighting Kim Kardashian's admission of Botox while denying everything else.</p><p>Criticism also extended to Allure, as some fans questioned the credibility of the magazine. One individual mentioned their initial interest in reading about the "science of natural beauty" but lost enthusiasm upon seeing Kim Kardashian featured, implying a perception of the magazine underestimating its readers' intelligence.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Kim Kardashian Might Have Made A Mistake Asking Viewers What They Want To See On The Kardashians</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Last 2022, during her interview with Allure, Kardashian emphasized that she had never undergone plastic surgery. She shared insights into the cosmetic procedures she has tried and the launch of her <a href=#>nine-step skincare line with outrageous prices, SKKN by Kim</a>. "I've never had eyelash extensions. I've never done anything… I've never filled my cheeks. I've never filled my lips. My eyebrows are real…" The beauty mogul also expressed her desire to maintain an appropriate appearance at her age, she also cautioned against going too far with cosmetic work.</p><h2 id=what-cosmetic-procedures-has-kim-kardashian-admitted-to>What Cosmetic Procedures Has Kim Kardashian Admitted To?</h2><p>Kim Kardashian expressed her <a href=#>preference for cosmetic procedures that maintain her recognizable appearance</a>, "I'm 41. I always want to look appropriate. There does come a point when you've taken it too far — overfilled, too tight, too much cosmetic work. There's nothing worse," she told Allure in 2022.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/kimtoday-instarmage.png><p>While she avoids certain procedures, the mother of four has been open to trying unconventional methods in her pursuit of looking her best. In 2013, Kardashian gained attention for sharing a bloody selfie on Instagram after undergoing a vampire facial, a procedure that combines micro-dermabrasion with a platelet-rich plasma mask. However, she later admitted that the experience was extremely painful, "It was honestly the most painful thing ever! It's the one treatment that I'll never do again."</p><p>In an interview with The New York Times in 2022, Kardashian made headlines by stating she would go to great lengths to maintain her youthfulness, "If you told me that I literally had to eat poop every single day and I would look younger, I might, I just might."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>After giving birth to North and Saint, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Kim Kardashian had her post-pregnancy stretch marks removed, and her belly button tightened</a> through a procedure performed by her cosmetic dermatologist, Dr. Simon Ourian.

"I went to go get a cortisone shot in my butt. One of my neighbors was a dermatologist at Cedars. I go in there, and he's like, 'There's a one in a billion chance that you will get a huge indent in your butt.' Of course, I get a huge indent on my butt," she explained after a photo of her surfaced causing speculation about butt implants.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In 2019, Kardashian documented her neck laser treatment at the Skin Thesis skincare clinic. She tried the clinic's 4D Tightening Laser, which stimulates collagen production and remodels the skin without the need for injectables. She emphasized the importance of her neck area when she shared her procedure on her Instagram stories.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>The Kardashians Are Known For Having Plastic Surgery, But Kourtney Has One Major Regret</a></span></p><p>Additionally, Kardashian revealed her appreciation for the Morpheous laser treatment, known for its stomach and abdomen tightening effects. "I think this is my fave laser, but it's painful lol but worth it!" she shared on her Instagram story.</p><p>While Kim Kardashian has built a reputation for denying plastic surgery rumors, her recent admission of receiving Botox in her neck may reveal a shift in her approach to transparency towards self-acceptance and the balance she seeks between maintaining her desired appearance and embracing her natural beauty.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiioqVdoK6zsMCsn6KZnqh6sbjArKuim12owrOzxKuwZpyVo7aiuIywn7Jlo52ybq3DpqCtrJWZerW7jKCcrayZo7Rurs6tprFlmaN6qbHRZqWem5tk</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fkim-kardashians-plastic-surgery-denial-why-she-admitted-to-getting-botox-in-her-neck.html&text=Kim%20Kardashian%27s%20Plastic%20Surgery%20Denial%20Is%20Legendary%20But%20Here%27s%20Why%20She%20Admitted%20To%20Getting%20Botox%20In&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fkim-kardashians-plastic-surgery-denial-why-she-admitted-to-getting-botox-in-her-neck.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fkim-kardashians-plastic-surgery-denial-why-she-admitted-to-getting-botox-in-her-neck.html&title=Kim%20Kardashian%27s%20Plastic%20Surgery%20Denial%20Is%20Legendary%20But%20Here%27s%20Why%20She%20Admitted%20To%20Getting%20Botox%20In" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fkim-kardashians-plastic-surgery-denial-why-she-admitted-to-getting-botox-in-her-neck.html&title=Kim%20Kardashian%27s%20Plastic%20Surgery%20Denial%20Is%20Legendary%20But%20Here%27s%20Why%20She%20Admitted%20To%20Getting%20Botox%20In" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fkim-kardashians-plastic-surgery-denial-why-she-admitted-to-getting-botox-in-her-neck.html&title=Kim%20Kardashian%27s%20Plastic%20Surgery%20Denial%20Is%20Legendary%20But%20Here%27s%20Why%20She%20Admitted%20To%20Getting%20Botox%20In" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fkim-kardashians-plastic-surgery-denial-why-she-admitted-to-getting-botox-in-her-neck.html&description=Kim%20Kardashian%27s%20Plastic%20Surgery%20Denial%20Is%20Legendary%20But%20Here%27s%20Why%20She%20Admitted%20To%20Getting%20Botox%20In" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./kyle-richards-shares-diet-secrets-after-denying-using-ozempic.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Kyle Richards Shares Diet Secrets After Denying Using Ozempic">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./209959-jenna-bush-hagers-husband-henry-hilariou-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Jenna Bush Hager's Husband Henry Hilariously Crashes Her Chat with Hoda to Ask about His Haircut">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
