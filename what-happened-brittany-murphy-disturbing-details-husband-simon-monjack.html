Brittany Murphy was such a talented actress, and we likely would have seen her go on to make many more hit movies if she were still alive today. HBO's recent 2-part documentary What Happened, Brittany Murphy? took a deep dive into the actress's marriage and health in her final months to try to answer questions that have been puzzling the public since her sudden death in 2009. Though the documentary is only about two hours between its two parts, it packs a punch in terms of surprising revelations.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Brittany Murphy's Documentary Reveals Her Shockingly Frail Physique At The Time Of Her Death</a></span></p><p>Though many were already suspicious of <a href=#>her marriage to Simon Monjack </a>and the control he held over her life, the documentary provides an inside look at some of the more bizarre details of their relationship. Brittany Murphy's failing health and frail physique were already a cause for concern around friends and collaborators, but the extent of her illness, revealed in the documentary, will be surprising to even the most suspicious internet sleuths who passed around theories about her cause of death. Here are 7 disturbing details we learned watching What Happened, Brittany Murphy?</p><h2 id=her-marriage-was-reclusive-and-bizarre><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Her Marriage Was Reclusive And Bizarre</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Brittany Murphy married her husband Simon Monjack soon after meeting him and the pair quickly sequestered themselves from the world. He reportedly drove Brittany to sets where she was working but would wait close by and she would spend her breaks with him in the car. Soon, they were almost entirely reclusive. Former People journalist Sara Hammel stated, "Simon and Brittany <a href=#>were basically locked up</a> in that house. They did these really weird photoshoots in the middle of the night where he would dress her like a doll. She became increasingly insecure about her appearance, increasingly paranoid about people being out to get her."</p><h2 id=simon-controlled-her-communication-with-the-outside-world><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Simon Controlled Her Communication With The Outside World</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Brittany's friends reported that soon after her marriage began, her numbers had changed and they couldn't get in touch with her. Sara Hammel stated, "Simon had the landlines disconnected, so the only way you could reach Sharon or Brittany was through Simon." Alex Merkin, a director who had worked with Brittany in Across the Hall, said, "I learned that she didn't have access to her own email address. I learned she had no access to her own phone, and if I wanted to reach her, I had to <a href=#>reach her through him</a> [Simon]."</p><h2 id=she-was-obsessive-about-her-appearance><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>She Was Obsessive About Her Appearance</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Brittany Murphy's friend Kathy Najimy, also an actress, said Brittany shared with her her <a href=#>concerns over her weight</a> and began dropping weight rapidly. "She said, 'That's what I've been told, if I want to be considered as a leading lady, I needed to lose a lot of weight,'" Kathy said. Sara Hammel also said Simon Monjack encouraged Brittany to get more and more plastic surgery, citing imperfections in her nose, chin, and teeth.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Was Brittany Murphy Ever Really Eminem's Girlfriend?</a></span></p><h2 id=simon-got-her-fired-from-her-last-job><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Simon Got Her Fired From Her Last Job</span></h2><p>Brittany Murphy had just begun filming in Puerto Rico for The Caller when she was abruptly fired only two days into filming. While details are murky, many around her assert that Simon had something to do with it. The assistant coronor, Ed Winter, said, "We found that evidently Simon got involved. I don't know if he slapped somebody or hit somebody and she got fired."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Twitter Attacks Perez Hilton For His Role In Brittany Murphy's Tragic Death</a></span></p><h2 id=brittany-brittany-39-s-mom-sharon-and-simon-all-came-down-with-the-same-illness><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Brittany, Brittany's Mom Sharon, And Simon All Came Down With The Same Illness</span></h2><p>While in Puerto Rico, Brittany, Simon, and Brittany's mom Sharon, who lived and traveled with the couple, <a href=#>all came down with flu-like symptoms</a>. When they went back to Los Angeles after Brittany's firing, she began taking over-the-counter medications for her illness, which would eventually contribute to her death. A pattern emerged of staying up late and not getting enough rest, further diminishing her immune system. Brittany's official cause of death was untreated pneumonia, as well as anemia and complications from her heavy use of drugs and over-the-counter prescriptions.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=simon-and-sharon-39-s-relationship-raised-some-eyebrows><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Simon And Sharon's Relationship Raised Some Eyebrows</span></h2><p>Simon Monjack and Brittany's mom Sharon continued to live together <a href=#>after Brittany Murphy's death</a>, a fact that struck a lot of people as suspicious. Ed Winter said, "There were several little indicators that <a href=#>something didn't feel right</a>. Sharon was sitting on the couch and she'd cry a little bit. Then she'd stop and she'd talk to Simon or say something and then she'd start crying again." An interview they gave together with Larry King raised eyebrows from many who believed their relationship, while probably not romantic, was strange, to say the least.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=even-simon-monjack-39-s-mother-admitted-he-could-be-controlling><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Even Simon Monjack's Mother Admitted He Could Be Controlling</span></h2><p>Linda Monjack was interviewed in the docuseries and had some interesting things to say about her son. "<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">He had an IQ off the scale. He was able to charm anyone. </a>From early childhood Simon had that ability to manipulate the environment to get what he wanted out of it." Of his marriage to Brittany Murphy, she said, "They were very much in love...but it's a very fine line…between controlling somebody and managing them to have the best career."</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>The Cast Of The 90s Teen Classic 'Clueless': Ranked By Current Net Worth</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoZmkYrWivM%2BepZ6cXZe%2FqsDTmqWyZZ2qv7G02Gaboqukqr%2Bjtc2gZJ2dpJa2rb%2BMoaysmpGjsW6%2FyKamp2WdpLurrcKkZg%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fwhat-happened-brittany-murphy-disturbing-details-husband-simon-monjack.html&text=%27What%20Happened%2c%20Brittany%20Murphy%3f%27%3a%20The%20Most%20Disturbing%20Details&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwhat-happened-brittany-murphy-disturbing-details-husband-simon-monjack.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwhat-happened-brittany-murphy-disturbing-details-husband-simon-monjack.html&title=%27What%20Happened%2c%20Brittany%20Murphy%3f%27%3a%20The%20Most%20Disturbing%20Details" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fwhat-happened-brittany-murphy-disturbing-details-husband-simon-monjack.html&title=%27What%20Happened%2c%20Brittany%20Murphy%3f%27%3a%20The%20Most%20Disturbing%20Details" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fwhat-happened-brittany-murphy-disturbing-details-husband-simon-monjack.html&title=%27What%20Happened%2c%20Brittany%20Murphy%3f%27%3a%20The%20Most%20Disturbing%20Details" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwhat-happened-brittany-murphy-disturbing-details-husband-simon-monjack.html&description=%27What%20Happened%2c%20Brittany%20Murphy%3f%27%3a%20The%20Most%20Disturbing%20Details" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./15-cars-that-can-park-themselves-better-than-you.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="15 Cars That Can Park Themselves Better Than You">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./fuller-house-cast-net-worth-ranked-bob-saget-candace-cameron-bure.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="The Cast Of 'Fuller House,' Ranked By Net Worth">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
