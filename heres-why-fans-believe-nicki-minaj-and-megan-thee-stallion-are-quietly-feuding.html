The plan worked as Minaj ended up going on Live with Stallion, before agreeing to do the track (includes vocals by R&B star Ty Dolla $ign).</p><p>Despite all of the success that came with “Hot Girl Summer,” though, nobody would have expected the way in which this friendship appeared to fizzle out. Here’s the lowdown…</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=are-nicki-and-megan-feuding>Are Nicki And Megan Feuding?</h2><p>In a December 2019 interview with E!’s Daily Pop, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Stallion reflected on the success of “Hot Girl Summer”</a> while gushing how proud and delighted she was to have had the opportunity of working with Minaj so early into her career.</p><p>“We just went live together and she literally recorded her verse that night. They sent the song to me and I was like, ‘This is not real life. Y’all are playing right now,’” she recalled before talking about Minaj’s verse. “I love it. It was amazing. I can’t believe she did it so fast.”</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Real Reason Why Rapper Mulatto Was Forced To Change Her Stage Name</a></span></p><p>During her chat, she was also asked what she made of fans who are known to pit artists against one another — particularly when there’s a new female rapper emerging — to which Stallion said she has no issues with nobody.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“It’s really like a lot of the fans. They really make it seem like you’re picking sides,” the self-proclaimed Hot Girl expressed.</p><p>“I really, really, really like both of them. They’re two different people, two different rappers. It’s not even the same. I feel like we need to stop trying to compare them. I love both of them, so I would definitely like to collab with Cardi too.”</p><p>Well, in August 2020, Stallion and Cardi did end up collaborating on their smash hit WAP, which broke all kinds of records, selling over 5 million copies in the US and, unsurprisingly, shooting to the top spot of Billboard’s Hot 100.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Nicki Minaj & Other Female Rappers Who Helped Shape Hip Hop</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It became Stallion’s first No. 1.</p><p>While doing promotional work for the song, Stallion continuously spouted how she had been longing to work with Cardi, which Minaj’s fans were puzzled by since it was only the year prior when the “Body” star said she wouldn’t work with people who don’t write their own music.</p><p>She made the remark during her Instagram Live session with Minaj, which many people took as a dig at Cardi while openly showing her support for the “Super Bass” hitmaker. So, when Stallion then opted to work with Cardi and started to completely disregard “HGS,” something seemed up.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Minaj’s fans then started questioning why Stallion ended up being a no-show for a taping of Queen Radio in August 2019 — surely they weren’t already feuding just after having put out their single, right?</p><p>People took note that Stallion was absent, but Minaj had brushed it off, saying that her guest couldn’t be there and abruptly moved on from the topic.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Fans Call Nicki Minaj, Drake, And Little Wayne’s Collab The Rebirth Of Real Hip Hop</a></span></p><p>The Barbz have gone on to claim that since her collar with Cardi, Stallion has shown the latter nothing but love — more than the love she showed for Minaj.</p><p>It didn’t make sense. Stallion first says she doesn’t want to work with people using ghostwriters and respects true artistry but then teams up with Cardi and begins to distance herself from Minaj.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In January 2021, the “Hard White” lyricist made the move and unfollowed Stallion on Instagram, and while people are still trying to get to the bottom of what really happened between the two, it seems to be deeper than Stallion working with Cardi.</p><p>In her song “Seeing Green,” released in May 2021, the Barbz were convinced that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Minaj had indirectly taken a dig at Stallion</a> as she raps, “One Margarita pizza with Parmesan and garlic. These bitches thirsty, I can see why they alcoholics.”</p><p>Then, in June 2021, Stallion released her single “Thot S***,” where she appears to take aim at Minaj, rapping, I'm the big homie, but I ain't the oldest, hmm / B**** dry hatin', tryna get noticed. Man, ain't nobody come to see you, Otis, look.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While fans are still trying to get to the bottom of this feud, it’s fair to say that Minaj and Stallion are not seeing eye-to-eye.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Fans Call Out Rihanna For Biting Nicki Minaj’s Shoe Style</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGifnqqVqHq4tNhmnZqmo2KvprjInq2eZZ6esKy1jKagp5maYq6vsIymnKCZnmLBqbHEZqqtmZyhtrC6jJqpnmWhqramwMuyZJ%2BdpZm2r7OO</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fheres-why-fans-believe-nicki-minaj-and-megan-thee-stallion-are-quietly-feuding.html&text=Heres%20Why%20Fans%20Believe%20Nicki%20Minaj%20And%20Megan%20Thee%20Stallion%20Are%20Quietly%20Feuding&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fheres-why-fans-believe-nicki-minaj-and-megan-thee-stallion-are-quietly-feuding.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fheres-why-fans-believe-nicki-minaj-and-megan-thee-stallion-are-quietly-feuding.html&title=Heres%20Why%20Fans%20Believe%20Nicki%20Minaj%20And%20Megan%20Thee%20Stallion%20Are%20Quietly%20Feuding" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fheres-why-fans-believe-nicki-minaj-and-megan-thee-stallion-are-quietly-feuding.html&title=Heres%20Why%20Fans%20Believe%20Nicki%20Minaj%20And%20Megan%20Thee%20Stallion%20Are%20Quietly%20Feuding" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fheres-why-fans-believe-nicki-minaj-and-megan-thee-stallion-are-quietly-feuding.html&title=Heres%20Why%20Fans%20Believe%20Nicki%20Minaj%20And%20Megan%20Thee%20Stallion%20Are%20Quietly%20Feuding" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fheres-why-fans-believe-nicki-minaj-and-megan-thee-stallion-are-quietly-feuding.html&description=Heres%20Why%20Fans%20Believe%20Nicki%20Minaj%20And%20Megan%20Thee%20Stallion%20Are%20Quietly%20Feuding" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./bella-banos.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="IS Bella Banos Still Dating Scott Disick?
