With its strange characters, catchy and interesting songs, and bizarre plot (or even lack thereof, according to some), it's no wonder that The Rocky Horror Picture Show quickly became a cult classic.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The film, which initially did poorly in initial screening with critics, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">had its national release canceled</a>. In a last-ditch effort to keep the film in circulation, the studio made a deal with Bill Quigley, the owner of the Waverly Theater, to allow the film to be run during its midnight showings.</p><p>The midnight showings of The Rocky Horror Picture Show became a hit thanks largely in part to Tim Curry's portrayal of Dr. Frank-N-Furter, <a href=#>a character that was admittedly inspired by none other than Cruella De Vil</a>, and thus was born the cult classic that many know and love today.</p><p>Those that have watched the film, whether at home or at a theater with a shadow cast, are sure to have noticed other top Hollywood figures alongside Curry in the movie, and may even recognize other cast members from other works they continued to do after The Rocky Horror Picture Show took off.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=tim-curry-meat-loaf-and-susan-sarandon-continued-to-rise-to-stardom>Tim Curry, Meat Loaf, And Susan Sarandon Continued To Rise To Stardom</h2><p>Perhaps the most recognizable names and faces on the cast are Tim Curry, Meat Loaf, and Susan Sarandon. Tim Curry is a Hollywood legend who was launched into stardom shortly after playing the bizarre Dr. Frank-N-Furter.</p><p>Curry has had many recognizable roles throughout his career, such as Pennywise in Stephen King's television adaptation of IT, Dr. Anton Sevarius in the animated Gargoyles series, and Gomez Addams in the Addams Family Reunion television movie.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# title="Why Laverne Cox Nearly Quit Acting For Good">Why Laverne Cox Nearly Quit Acting For Good</a></span></p><p>Tim Curry is recognizable as many well-known voices in children's television shows as well, most notably Nigel Thornberry for Nickelodeon's The Wild Thornberrys. Curry continues to voice act and has recently appeared in the reboot of The Rocky Horror Picture Show starring Laverne Cox.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Singer Meat Loaf was fresh on the scene when he first rode his motorcycle on-screen during Rocky Horror. He continued to make and release music throughout the 1970s and 1980s and is well known for his song I'd Do Anything for Love (But I Won't Do That).</p><p>Meat Loaf continued acting roles as well, making appearances in films such as Fight Club, Tenacious D in the Pick of Destiny, and Waynes World. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">According to his biography on IMDb</a>, Meat Loaf sadly passed away due to COVID-19 complications on January 20th, 2022.</p><p>While Susan Sarandon <a href=#>experienced some tough times while shooting as Janet during The Rocky Horror Picture Show</a>, that did not stop her career from continuing to move forward and propel her into leading lady royalty.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Some of Sarandon's most well-known roles are as Jane Spofford in The Witches of Eastwick, Louise in Thelma & Louise, and Alicia Green in Rescue Me.</p><p>Sarandon's career blossomed to include many television roles as well and she still has many roles in the pipeline, <a href=#>including the highly anticipated Blue Beetle film</a>.</p><h2 id=some-went-on-to-television-and-voice-acting-and-have-worked-together-again>Some Went On To Television And Voice Acting, And Have Worked Together Again.</h2><p>A few of the actors from The Rocky Horror Picture Show went on to become the voices of some people's childhoods.</p><p>Richard O'Brien, who acted as Riff Raff, and Barry Bostwick, who played Brad Majors, both worked on the Disney Channel animated series Phineas and Ferb, a show that was (and still is) incredibly popular among children of the early 2000s.</p><p>O'Brien voiced reoccurring character Lawrence Fletcher, while Bostwick appeared in several episodes and Grandma Clyde Flynn. The creators of The Rocky Horror Picture Show reunited O'Brien with Patricia Quinn, Nell Campbell, and Jeremy Newson, all of whom are Rocky Horror alums, for another strange project titled Shock Treatment.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# title="How Close Did Tim Curry Come To Playing The Joker?">How Close Did Tim Curry Come To Playing The Joker?</a></span></p><p>Patricia Quinn was already a well-known Irish actress by the time she joined the cast of Rocky Horror as Magenta, and continued to have many roles in television throughout her career, including another little cult classic by the name of Doctor Who.</p><p>Nell Campbell portrayed the iconic Columbia and ended up signing a record deal with A&M records after her appearance in The Rocky Horror Picture Show.</p><p>Campbell starred in some off-Broadway productions and also continued to have small roles in television. Nell Campbell broadened her horizons by also opening a nightclub named after herself and two restaurants in New York, has written magazine articles, and recently appeared in a film called Seriously Red.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>British actor Jonathan Adams already had a pretty established career before playing Dr. Everett V. Scott, and appeared in many television series throughout his lifetime. Adams sadly passed away in 2005 from a stroke at the age of 74.</p><p>Similarly, Charles Gray was also a well-established actor before he accepted the role of The Criminologist in the cult classic, and continued to appear in many television movies and series until he ultimately passed away at age 71.</p><h2 id=peter-hinwood-quietly-exited-acting-and-some-went-behind-the-scenes>Peter Hinwood Quietly Exited Acting, And Some Went Behind The Scenes</h2><p>While Jeremy Newson played Ralph Hapschatt in both The Rocky Horror Picture Show and Shock Treatment, Newson settled into roles behind the camera instead of in front of it.</p><p>Jeremy Newson began directing, writing, and producing instead, having both producing and directing credits for The Shakespeare Job and The Look.</p><p>Newson passed away in 2020 due to a neurological disorder.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# title="The Real Origin Of The â€˜90s Cult-Classic â€˜The Craftâ€™">The Real Origin Of The â€˜90s Cult-Classic â€˜The Craftâ€™</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Peter Hinwood played the titular character, Rocky Horror.
