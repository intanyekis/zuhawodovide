Mathew was accused of living a double life by enjoying an 18-month affair, during which time his fling Alexsandra Wright had learned she was pregnant with his baby.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Beyonce hasn’t shared the best relationship with her dad in the last 10 years considering all that’s happened. But where does the pair’s bond stand today and are they still somewhat close? Here’s the lowdown…</p><h2 id=beyonce-s-estranged-relationship-with-her-dad>Beyonce’s Estranged Relationship With Her Dad</h2><p>Well, it’s no secret that the “Single Ladies” hitmaker is nowhere near as close to Mathew as she used to be.</p><p>After wrapping her I Am… World Tour, millions in revenue had disappeared and the blame was pushed on Mathew, who was already making a huge cut as manager and director.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Keri Hilson Says She’s Reconciled With Beyoncé (And Wants To Collab)</a></span></p><p>According to court documents, Mathew had “pilfered her [Beyonce] funds while he was her manager,” <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Rolling Stone</a> writes. This was then confirmed by an audit which had been conducted by Bey’s legal team, prompting in the manager’s firing from his role.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Mathew was adamant that he had nothing to do with money from the tour going missing, despite an investigation into the situation saying otherwise. Live Nation was later hired to take over Mathew’s job as the singer’s manager ever since.</p><p>"I have absolutely have not taken any money from Beyonce, and all dollars will be accounted for,” Mathew had told The Associated Press in 2011. "In no way have we stole money. Again, this about the people who have made these claims -- they have to come into the light.”</p><p>All of this drama occurred just two years after Beyonce’s mom had filed for divorce, but the process wasn’t finalized until 2011.</p><p>Their split was brought upon by Mathew’s two-year-long affair with Alexsandra Wright whom he would later welcome a child with. The situation was inexcusable and prompted a rift between Mathew and his daughters.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Beyonce Once Bought Jay-Z A Jet For $40 Million, But What Did He Buy Her In Return?</a></span></p><p>Tina, who was married to Mathew for 33 years was devastated, but the split was even harder on Beyonce given that her dad was still managing her career at the time. But it appeared that after everything with the tour happened, she had all the reason to ditch her father from her life and her team.</p><p>In August 2020, Tina spoke out about her divorce ordeal in an interview on the OWN virtual series Girlfriends Check-in, inviting that both Beyonce — and her younger daughter Solange Knowles — played a tremendous role in helping her get through the split.</p><p>“When I went through my divorce I was devastated after 33 years of marriage. Not because I wanted to stay in the marriage but just because I was like ‘oh my God I failed at this and I am 59-years-old,” she said.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“They [Beyoncé and Solange] came over and looked at old movies with me, we ate ice cream all night. They let me feel sorry for myself for a short period of time and then they were like momma ‘you’re a bad girl!’”</p><p>Though Beyonce doesn’t see her dad as much as she used to — and rightfully so — she had <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">her father show up to her Houston show</a> when the Formation World Tour made its stop in Texas in May 2016.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Every Project Blue Ivy Has Been Involved With So Far</a></span></p><p>The pair were all smiled as they posed for a photo backstage, which appeared to have been taken by Tina, who published the snap on her Instagram with the caption, “Houston Concert proud dad.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Despite apparent (yet still alleged) financial problems while under the management of Mathew, Beyonce was quick to act by hiring a new team with Live Nation, who have helped the mother of three amass a fortune valued at $355 million.</p><p>Beyonce remains one of the best-selling R&B singers of all time with current endorsement deals including Adidas and a $60 million deal with Netflix which she inked back in 2019.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Why Beyoncé Owes Her Career To This Girl Group</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiZnrGfo7CmedGeo5qsmaS7tLTIqWSfmaSdsrN5zJqrraCVrHqsus6lnKxn</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fbeyonce-relationship-father-matthew-knoles.html&text=What%27s%20Beyonce%27s%20Relationship%20Like%20With%20Her%20Father%20Matthew%20Knoles%3f&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fbeyonce-relationship-father-matthew-knoles.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fbeyonce-relationship-father-matthew-knoles.html&title=What%27s%20Beyonce%27s%20Relationship%20Like%20With%20Her%20Father%20Matthew%20Knoles%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fbeyonce-relationship-father-matthew-knoles.html&title=What%27s%20Beyonce%27s%20Relationship%20Like%20With%20Her%20Father%20Matthew%20Knoles%3f" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fbeyonce-relationship-father-matthew-knoles.html&title=What%27s%20Beyonce%27s%20Relationship%20Like%20With%20Her%20Father%20Matthew%20Knoles%3f" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fbeyonce-relationship-father-matthew-knoles.html&description=What%27s%20Beyonce%27s%20Relationship%20Like%20With%20Her%20Father%20Matthew%20Knoles%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./who-is-gabby-prescod-from-summer-house-season-7-574219-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Who Is Gabby Prescod From Summer House Season 7?">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./travis-kelce-wants-babies-taylor-swift-soon-shes-ready-agrees-prenup.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Travis Kelce Reportedly Wants Babies With Taylor Swift As Soon As Shes Ready After He Agrees To P">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
