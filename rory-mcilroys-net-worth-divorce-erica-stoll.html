Although McIlroy hails from the Ireland, the family currently lives in Jupiter, Florida, as noted by the US Sun. According to the Associated Press, the divorce filings shared that <strong>the former couple’s marriage was “irretrievably broken.”</strong> Furthermore, McIlroy’s legal team is adamant that <strong>the prenuptial agreement that both McIlroy and Stoll signed back in 2017</strong> be put into force.
